700f48300fa8def127637b87e04b7e68 it was easy enough to remove the X Y  and there was only one way the battery could be inserted  .
ee31d7df41f71e9ae037cdf06e1512c9 to my ears  a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd  and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a X cd Y  .
55dab1cfdddd4a895855e44900c1da52  scroll Y more X than on earlier models  .

fb3aa19e10f1dae6b9413cfe33af040c  equipment included is average  but that is nt a X Y since thats not what you are buying it for  .

00b26e308a4b8730247f6846646d008a its far more difficult to X Y and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the X Y not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists  phone numbers  address books  ect like the Y  which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device   .
ba92443cb9a6e3b3c3a9255183b1c671 also  the sound is wonderful  my X Y were those X Y that this came with  .

bb25f76c14b817eebcf952611ddb3014 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod  but i have gotten use to them  and even at the beginning did not think would justify the X Y in price  .

bc8cb26f2e111e60b22ac940195a192f short Y  3 months  so i got the extended Y at X Y   occasional freeze up  easily fixed by popping out battery   somewhat X navigation Y  .

445b54a1e60413834b2b823f3b73a305 the X Y is nt any X Y it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful  .
f1d894ebed14f332b5be805d716739ef also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my X Y  .

d8fbb9053ab6bfa846842cec9c7375ac the X Y i see is that it does nt look like you can manage playlists from the nomad  it has to be done from the computer  .
ca693a4c5df2c07f651e149646f822a6 transfer through windows explorer  windows recognizes the jukebox as an X X Y  so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad  .
aa33d939f98b42cddc9a95271279c4a3 X tagging Y result  i think  from the nomad s operating system  .

c8196ec4c983af49734af374c87665fd on the subject of headphones  this thing seems like a X mp3 Y when you use the headphones they give you in the box  but invest 30 dollars in a X Y and the X Y goes up through the roof  .
21ebed2a97f528417ad5da338ef26ef7 now heres the stuff you should know starting with the X Y  the Y is really big and the X Y in the back is perfect  fast as hell in music transfer  controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button  X X and ive heard X mp3 Y  a ton of X equilizer Y Y on here  .

f17720aeafd313670cd2350bf2e39041 m3u files are used by X X Y like musicmatch and winamp  but not X  without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists   it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your Y  X or any X Y  all my 125 gb of Y were transferred to the zen with correct tags  hooray  .
c2d8dd4f0d593e4f1ccb35743b4a76bd my X Y about the nomad is the eax feature  .
ac35a2b46c21e2344be10bb8fcaad509 the included eax support is useful at times  especially when you listen to a variety of genres  as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a X Y  .
8121831049060e4e814eb90a284743c5 ive seen Y all  the archos  dell  ipods  everything  X Y and X X Y this one the best in my opinion  .
0274c135b199dbc2203f17aa3978816d third  the X Y continues with the case  .
63b191a3a9ad3bc38caa73ddb3d65fb1 because X Y that complain about this player are talking bull  this player is awesome  it just breaks fast  which is horrible  .
953d167adfbea5165b5b374987f15397 i have windows xp pro and when installing the X Y i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver  .
67bd9ef657ec9fe0e24675e255e6ee0d headphones suck  i would invest in some X Y since it has the eax feature  .
f2411c8e4e34052a33a2a92ad250283e i gave the zen 5 stars because it s excellent for the Y that it is in and it s not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a X Y  .
595586dcd393895e2ca8c8a038c133b3 the zen does nt support folders so it is not really a storage device  even with X party Y that  creates  folders  documents and programs can t be launched from the zen  so it is not a X Y  it s a storage device at best  .
15c31085c6c71aeacffc1df322ba7655 the player is intuitive and outputs X X Y  .
a88ee172e70d1886ca28bcf0b5ba1d06 as mentioned in X Y the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away  .

ea4fb8598a87486371fe751a009ec959 finding a X song  Y  or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy  .
3fd077cfdb53680671d6b273e8b56c20 a X Y at a X Y with X Y that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be  .
7967db31bc77438a94a846ddeb630669 finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels  first it is poorly integrated into the X Y and clunky to use especially with tagging and X the wma audio Y sucks  flat out sucks in terms of X Y compared with the vastly X aac Y the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store  which  if you ever plan to pay for your music  is by far the best  .
23437ff0a6808a5975343315b39f966d plusses are the easy to remove battery and the X Y produced by the nomad  .
22b951ffa2f0d17cc9b029bd85dcdf41 it has a X X Y that allows you to see everything on the screen easily  .
de8c0ea32caab8f743c60c243bf98ff9 but the sound is very good  and loud  and works well on my X Y  .

f36365781e2d87d761d5f6c5b23a90ab in fact  each of my X mp3 Y had software problem in the X Y  .
98403a16cdeed60e2113243a13b306bf i have no problem using the Y itself and i feel it is a very X Y  .
f7e215562ee1a9103ae0258748c464f7 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use  hardware and software   X Y and value for the price  .
a38439d7c15e4548fd748f4b11dd2e65  the controls are much inferior to the X ipod Y  .
e17e18380718fc3b0a9d1deacbd92ff8 this Y is an X Y with a couple of X Y that potential buyers should be wary of  and all readers need to know about a X party Y Y that resolves virtually all of the X Y file transfer Y  .
25da27d72af155af06e6c5874f503ef7 once again  the sound is awesome  the X Y is only 68 hours  and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery Y  .
27f13efb1c6d5d29bb29db0c4901feed the X Y with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software  .
