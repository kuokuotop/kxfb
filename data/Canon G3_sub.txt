41d67c7360f1eaff9b82be88ea00f3d7 i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options  shutter Y  X Y  X metering Y  etc  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear  .
865f5ce19fc754d56e712de777b1bcae contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with X Y  just as it does with the X Y from canon  .

449b83653dd0d66d7d910483ebd3238b but at the X Y  it takes X Y very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it  .
861626d0cc4cc5ae19684d4b8d53194c even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the X X Y X under  1200  .
3dd55b27114ec5fd6815b8c30aa6e44f the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the Y X of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me  .
1f8107d369d0a9aff676c54f789d4256 the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives X Y in aperture priority  shutter priority  and X Y  .
d189707ad42028eec72db14fec45c699 relative to what i can easily achieve with X Y on my nikon slr  the X Y on the g3 produces X  X Y with ugly hot spots  .

7ce68523e9bd23cb9fa8f5c8bfadfa9f the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very X lag Y before it focuslocks  even in X Y   and the X Y Y of the X Y  .
2d02822aaf070b5602c867e2c6872e5d rather heavy for point and shoot but a X Y for semi pros  .
