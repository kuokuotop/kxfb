5b3c35f2d0200b492eb1d84caff2bd26 [picture],[],it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
48c9089c4729e58f320f3da81288ee13 [viewfinder],[],to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
67b82e06f82e9130f9d542e0ab393f06 [design],[],this camera has a major design flaw .
147a916c1effce3110d2582e4b8b49a5 [viewfinder],[],when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
c011703935a9bcb4fe2a8bf0e1e00a40 [camera],[],everything else about the camera is great .
2acf539000dfb941b35ec78656c5b1b5 [camera],[],if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
a7d8e305d570d95f2e66cc869353dc9a [lens],[],the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
3bce35cc8493a2cd4c47a2a358643b7c [lcd],[],the moveable lcd screen is great .
a4bf04bb2ffffdf15f1e93ccd942ba31 [remote],[],the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
7168bc93960c3ccae9ad72cc71ab956b [battery],[],i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
41d67c7360f1eaff9b82be88ea00f3d7 [manual],[],i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
84224827af1c6fbe4ff62db111e2e0b4 [highlight],[],i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
5a88ccedfd94e24afcf32afe34d0dad6 [body],[],and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
c24124e72afb21806504f88eb5809b93 [download],[],i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
34400085cb3b7c1e079b9e19bd044b91 [camera],[],i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
5d8b5507ce45f152c58e301e745b132e [camera,use,photo],[],very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
682f66e2e701df8ae5c2394498111504 [g3],[],i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
ab5381ff92d93f31f37a3da98c2c14a6 [camera],[],all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
ebe4e490a3d80b57d701bfa3b8e96ec7 [optic],[],canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
e30184599d5c95a24e9a14a132efb341 [look],[],the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
861626d0cc4cc5ae19684d4b8d53194c [camera],[],even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
c014bc886849ad4649bc5b4f66967a90 [camera],[],definetely a great camera .
1a2ff0b2fd0f3902bbc4db99f334bf30 [quality,lens],[],proven canon built quality and lens .
4073922627870a25467c904c1f869dfc [feel],[],feels solid in hand .
2d02822aaf070b5602c867e2c6872e5d [weight,camera],[],rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
