726152eaeaf36e106f50419011dfab6a what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read X Y  .

9947e0d4813586c77a652fb805fbac2e the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a X X data Y without vcd formatting  .

a8ace68534381de6693b2cd4a413efea also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a X Y  .

700f48300fa8def127637b87e04b7e68 it was easy enough to remove the X Y  and there was only one way the battery could be inserted  .
ee31d7df41f71e9ae037cdf06e1512c9 to my ears  a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd  and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a X cd Y  .

ad451383a8f52970863fb60b1cd69f44 for some this might be a problem  but for the price of a 30 gig ipod  you can get a X Y  the ipod simply pales in comparison  .
fc1353a755e02d2292608b3ddaa8e8fa my  fast forward  button works  but it takes a X X Y on it to make it go  .

00b26e308a4b8730247f6846646d008a its far more difficult to X Y and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the X Y not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists  phone numbers  address books  ect like the Y  which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device   .
ba92443cb9a6e3b3c3a9255183b1c671 also  the sound is wonderful  my X Y were those X Y that this came with  .

b9bfe35c56e22b2e41d54ff0d9f5e938 for a price that s still less than even the X level Y i was able to get this X Y  and the X Y is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some  .
fe401e4c7ad5871abaee9660a3bbdd76 possibly the X Y this player has  if price was nt enough  is the fact that the user can replace the Y him  herself by opening the lid and popping in the X Y  .
4669d00c8621e9a0281e783c77782dd4 the lcd is larger than the X Y  the nx  and has a X X Y which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx s X Y did  .

ec45f347a448e896c123cf2716a5bcba compared to musicmatch  the Y has a X filing Y and X to use  .
445b54a1e60413834b2b823f3b73a305 the X Y is nt any X Y it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful  .
f1d894ebed14f332b5be805d716739ef also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my X Y  .
2c18484d512b4fc04c7dbcce1d30f543 i dont know what X Y are saying  but the software is awesome  .
b2c12395e7baa4db094eb94137f35655 i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it  it worked well when i set it on top of a X Y  but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment  .
995acd474024ab5500649725d2b02aae this Y is an X Y  .
8aa5d60d1152572e6165890c76430ad6 X Y  i wo nt necessarily say  X   but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate  .
d65b4f9868df8c7ec371d1551ba95d22 the cutouts for the controls is not thought out as there is too X Y in the way to adequately access the controls  especially the scroll wheel  .
fd02adeb0b3e3ad869f3f15173d5cd41 i purchased the nomad jukebox zen Y X and it is fantastic  .
ad71306ca9a64f28e317dd789b8d22d2  X Y completely X as is since it obscures display window  .
d8012015c19cafbf96cbc6cad5741bba i find all of the Y X and not X in the least  .
3e406d6f8231c62cced3fc27d645b1b8 what really made this a X mp3 Y for me was the software  .
ead02770ba3fff710bbb69f23f20558b the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery  just like any X X Y  .
c12383bb97c5145343b5078c02d465f5 the X Y i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are nt as easy as the ipod s  or as  sexy  looking  .
2e3f4a9da60918bdc961149cf8e14d7f 11  minimal pause between songs  less than that on X Y  X Y for a X based Y .
e4ac12789200e32ecf5a324b1e5e7bb1 the X Y makes things easy to see  and the writing is X enough for people to see  .
8d1f6697eefabe40a2bed7c33818a32d 12  X Y  my X cd Y in one X Y  5717 songs  491 albums and counting   .
d8fbb9053ab6bfa846842cec9c7375ac the X Y i see is that it does nt look like you can manage playlists from the nomad  it has to be done from the computer  .
ca693a4c5df2c07f651e149646f822a6 transfer through windows explorer  windows recognizes the jukebox as an X X Y  so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad  .
aa33d939f98b42cddc9a95271279c4a3 X tagging Y result  i think  from the nomad s operating system  .
046321e6f46dfb8659079eb3d885696d other Y  X Y  loads of presets for Y  X Y  still quite X and X despite being slightly bigger than an ipod  .
6a8f21acd626d0800eee6c1da079d11a it could be a X Y bigger  but it s easy to get used to  .
c8196ec4c983af49734af374c87665fd on the subject of headphones  this thing seems like a X mp3 Y when you use the headphones they give you in the box  but invest 30 dollars in a X Y and the X Y goes up through the roof  .
21ebed2a97f528417ad5da338ef26ef7 now heres the stuff you should know starting with the X Y  the Y is really big and the X Y in the back is perfect  fast as hell in music transfer  controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button  X X and ive heard X mp3 Y  a ton of X equilizer Y Y on here  .
e9d28867f6cc8362413781bc3fa7002f c i do love X Y which allows a oneclick synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer  .
4147498480996841498df2bb40d27af6 5  the X  X Y   50 from creative  is a X Y over the ipod s Y which costs  100 to replace  .
f17720aeafd313670cd2350bf2e39041 m3u files are used by X X Y like musicmatch and winamp  but not X  without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists   it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your Y  X or any X Y  all my 125 gb of Y were transferred to the zen with correct tags  hooray  .
c2d8dd4f0d593e4f1ccb35743b4a76bd my X Y about the nomad is the eax feature  .
ac35a2b46c21e2344be10bb8fcaad509 the included eax support is useful at times  especially when you listen to a variety of genres  as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a X Y  .
8121831049060e4e814eb90a284743c5 ive seen Y all  the archos  dell  ipods  everything  X Y and X X Y this one the best in my opinion  .
0274c135b199dbc2203f17aa3978816d third  the X Y continues with the case  .
63b191a3a9ad3bc38caa73ddb3d65fb1 because X Y that complain about this player are talking bull  this player is awesome  it just breaks fast  which is horrible  .
953d167adfbea5165b5b374987f15397 i have windows xp pro and when installing the X Y i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver  .
67bd9ef657ec9fe0e24675e255e6ee0d headphones suck  i would invest in some X Y since it has the eax feature  .
f2411c8e4e34052a33a2a92ad250283e i gave the zen 5 stars because it s excellent for the Y that it is in and it s not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a X Y  .
595586dcd393895e2ca8c8a038c133b3 the zen does nt support folders so it is not really a storage device  even with X party Y that  creates  folders  documents and programs can t be launched from the zen  so it is not a X Y  it s a storage device at best  .
15c31085c6c71aeacffc1df322ba7655 the player is intuitive and outputs X X Y  .
a88ee172e70d1886ca28bcf0b5ba1d06 as mentioned in X Y the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away  .

ea4fb8598a87486371fe751a009ec959 finding a X song  Y  or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy  .
3fd077cfdb53680671d6b273e8b56c20 a X Y at a X Y with X Y that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be  .
7967db31bc77438a94a846ddeb630669 finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels  first it is poorly integrated into the X Y and clunky to use especially with tagging and X the wma audio Y sucks  flat out sucks in terms of X Y compared with the vastly X aac Y the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store  which  if you ever plan to pay for your music  is by far the best  .
23437ff0a6808a5975343315b39f966d plusses are the easy to remove battery and the X Y produced by the nomad  .
22b951ffa2f0d17cc9b029bd85dcdf41 it has a X X Y that allows you to see everything on the screen easily  .

a38439d7c15e4548fd748f4b11dd2e65  the controls are much inferior to the X ipod Y  .
e17e18380718fc3b0a9d1deacbd92ff8 this Y is an X Y with a couple of X Y that potential buyers should be wary of  and all readers need to know about a X party Y Y that resolves virtually all of the X Y file transfer Y  .
25da27d72af155af06e6c5874f503ef7 once again  the sound is awesome  the X Y is only 68 hours  and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery Y  .
27f13efb1c6d5d29bb29db0c4901feed the X Y with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software  .

865f5ce19fc754d56e712de777b1bcae contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with X Y  just as it does with the X Y from canon  .
