f2411c8e4e34052a33a2a92ad250283e [zen],[],i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .

c7f5cceaff97a5d0b302626a5fbb9eca [player],[],i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .

8b9a6cd9df31ff13ae9cf191b5e2455f [support],[],but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
9cad5736da827e5d496c2741b7aabcef [size],[],sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
7c5f2cad9e33dd876fe73ed5afd2c719 [weight],[],it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .

83c0f79f8710192a88e6b91256723401 [player],[],the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .

913332dbee7c09d79b4e2d89d50983e3 [software],[],had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .

4b422478d2bfe45105ae6e24c6b27e46 [interface],[],the interface used could be better designed .
9d2b6df35824844c6e9e5f23b3c8b700 [case],[],and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
d65b4f9868df8c7ec371d1551ba95d22 [control],[],the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
79c1116733a016587698daee6f3b36a7 [firmware],[],quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
dddabe0a6ff5deb6dc9e3641be46c42d [warranty],[],i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !

5e3b041ac6b9ad8129dd2adbb704bd4e [price],[],the price compared to the ipod is great .
c797f7ccd54badc9e0db79b7ce27861a [price,battery],[],price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
a20c4c03f7b95629a438605bd146c7e8 [itunes],[],but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .

4f24be526a9c92068894b12a0079407e [price,feature],[],for the price and features it is really good .
76dae912cf2b027c4d69337edb58cb0f [navigation],[],in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
371fcb1667fb81be4f3ab2087f44f90e [navigation],[],you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
aa755efa485b6b2983cdb9916e3def2b [software],[],the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
061fa6633540533196c8541145f80a36 [software],[],so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .

3eab72409ccff3c92556a10118277041 [player],[],i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
00678fc65cf74c7bbfb5bf91f2796a34 [sound],[],the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .

b9063ee5751791fa6c9c7c2cfb04d687 [screen],[],b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
8e5d48144e2352fd121ac7d430fcfb1c [scroll],[],c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
2155dae2420356df58f64bd1e973732d [software],[],d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on

53a91a3802fc40bbba3c21c7e9355215 [look],[],f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
2bbf8f59d3110e4a4954aca45035a23a [software],[],the software failed repeatedly .
59b4d091b5111df77bfdded1137bcc19 [software],[],software downloads on the site crashed my pc .

b54b42cf02a97a211cfa0d30cb043a56 [scroll],[],another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
dea66d5317b71869a95016784c1b70fb [player],[],otherwise , this player is awesome !
22b951ffa2f0d17cc9b029bd85dcdf41 [screen],[],it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
f6623d38bfdb0e14da4f30b48146d4e8 [player],[],overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .

0d9ef93f4b9430a1a5d9813011b8bc79 [feature],[],there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
4bd98e3804be5a792f3b30af064b63d8 [battery],[],- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
fb3aa19e10f1dae6b9413cfe33af040c [equipment],[],- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .

9182663809b6095073a7d5f7266c9609 [player],[],so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
4669d00c8621e9a0281e783c77782dd4 [lcd],[],the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .

ac35a2b46c21e2344be10bb8fcaad509 [eax],[],the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .

5a9e2c56b3e4e5359842e5b8ef87d675 [size,price],[],lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
8569a7dfb307c605d7ba9f01dc118762 [sound],[],excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
ca693a4c5df2c07f651e149646f822a6 [transfer],[],transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
d9373416910359b8a385ab071d81a693 [transfer],[],i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
1a660d93ab7bcfe1d1d3d39c1c3b80e0 [storage],[],huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
b3664a72fc3d4305b40c634c0706c9c0 [transfer],[],having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
513d68e23304b9a241c2496abf036c5b [navigation],[],navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
dfeaf50d5e3cca7bf889853664f868cd [construction],[],cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
0e57ee572cc132a512fea07060c57adf [feel],[],the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
53c7c4556903767966dbc5683f8b126b [feel],[],as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
abb0cfc406cfd076ce7bde7f7535876d [play],[],the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
1570c8057aa673cb966b476bc21d70b2 [software],[],software - the software is crap .
08ab613078229543daf0da24f79ad268 [instruction],[],even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
d92ad8231981f8b3759771615f2c7a6e [control],[],controls are a bit awkward .
b306d893d4abfe8c7f979a77cfff7a5a [headphone],[],crappy headphones .
0474d0b6a9b1c4f3d8293ffb0fbdcf6b [earbud],[],the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
8aa5d60d1152572e6165890c76430ad6 [navigation],[],difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
6f6b408df12cf2cad628e4ee2887ebd5 [navigation],[],it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
af3486cf11b465100e02244c4ae682ee [control],[],up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
9c8b087ba299dc92014adb3b0c2157ec [case],[],it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
a5a636df118fc8a27663f81f5d541375 [case],[],as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
5fd8c0085bdee242af47218a4dee27e1 [sound,price,player],[],i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
5a2480b407a86683ba7b4076ad5e09f7 [price],[],for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
a5f896d9ee945727e18197eca9a18380 [button,interface],[],the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
80bbb11678af660f0125fc0dd5f8324c [display],[],simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
3d4574448c311e0ea8e5b1e7ad6fcdda [software],[],but the major problem i had was with the software .
b044707a805daadf2f4c1d1c24fefac8 [instruction],[],the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
445b54a1e60413834b2b823f3b73a305 [sync],[],the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
9551fc8f3d50538de5b346accd0212fa [transfer],[],i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
da922c938e7f865a42ddedacb2b59143 [interface],[],i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
a6e8231ff9a167e8b61fd68df9915109 [product],[],i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
911cf34fb4622eb08d94512ab5c12964 [software],[],the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
0a09b863b5f04c01db59378ac1f5c8f2 [headphone],[],the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
a8ca5ff27bcb6526b194c97f24e7c6f2 [navigation],[],took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
4e1901d8d28af75fad800cd14641edc1 [player],[],i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
f6bc4fd24b9be00f5b099c30cab47b22 [product],[],all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
2c92d650e105f7df5d4390b5bddf0006 [look,display],[],it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
01b06273acfb1e183ddcc7f38cb5108c [product],[],i would recommend this product to anyone .
b2d4e633a50cce494eea7a203213e6b5 [player],[],before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
205ba48000827a3b49562499e168cd48 [software],[],many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
8487498f2b6e44dd82814b6515fd3e74 [software],[],the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
44113db332ebb2a7be2326e83dd6db5a [control],[],the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
370f2f08bb8ba98db88f94c031ba3f60 [player,sound],[],the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
08c55a18e9f4a2e76d4f25dff8474868 [battery],[],the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
10d9cee24af6c9f6d40cb101d17311ca [playlist],[],playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
5d8a1adbeeaf90d9f03da0b3810f9ee5 [software,player],[],the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
e3acb2699c9fc9220bd3f2c7f00ad5c9 [navigation,scroll],[],the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
c7593f31f905682ecd393eb33a006c37 [playlist],[],creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
6215fd62148ab8893a49df9183f109ed [eax],[],the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
ada231d490de7ffd5bb32453d86341b0 [product],[],well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
d7971a11f5508d7b68fd3dc153dd2301 [product],[],well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
56b0b55a8c6aba813e567be6d65e17ac [program],[],well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
c88fd1bd55cbc6db568d9d4bfcf9d80b [player],[],not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
4654812eec1f697a9f4ce1e9c75d2a2c [transfer],[],oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
3b783a61d1de4aeff5e2bc59e9014361 [weight],[],a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
6ad951fc0c6d2c701335d2ce44de0d5e [button],[],the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
e4ac12789200e32ecf5a324b1e5e7bb1 [backlight],[],the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
c2d8dd4f0d593e4f1ccb35743b4a76bd [eax],[],my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
c97f7f5032697d824bf0078278432617 [earbud],[],but the earbuds suck !
0995bd9fc59fbcf1a0af1bf0c0da9dce [case],[],i forgot , the case does n't fit .
c990b6b1103f5a85ae4afcfa4dd6d607 [case],[],my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
2f8f641471bc4a57cee5c14765184d56 [sound],[],the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
3e406d6f8231c62cced3fc27d645b1b8 [software],[],what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
7507936ccfd024868889a9ca39083bf9 [bookmark],[],bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
2bfd3a824c2fea33fd6842c8e668b829 [bookmakr],[],rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
398cb319769bddd6c91cb1051d7c2e26 [bookmark],[],this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
77d109e2cb75e81b27de5ba3fb01ee7b [playlist],[],the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
fbfbef5022d2d4b5ac455d2b19cfa830 [nomad],[],i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
bb25f76c14b817eebcf952611ddb3014 [control],[],the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
1245c249dd265d331140ab5a14e99d42 [tag,software],[],my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
aa33d939f98b42cddc9a95271279c4a3 [tag],[],other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
2d3a5b4f342988ecdb571049d90c9e77 [software],[],also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
1ccdd0a015af2bd4872573b4f49a3672 [playlist],[],finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
f047713fd7ebf2002c5bc05f4ab2df80 [software],[],a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
3cb890299f26d6981ec2eb0866b852f3 [sync],[],first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
f8e21ab1b8a57bce5633ca8027b19bb4 [shuttle],[],the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
367132e3bd707c6fcb4fcfefdd6d2de8 [sync],[],second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
43eb564042d7bba0c26ccffc54663aaf [player],[],the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
54724dd286a492837cf9f736f866a74a [software],[],third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
af4ff3b60fd17fb4f6c20eea30e59606 [creative],[],for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
ab5959c7a51807b986ce61bb5891c023 [scroll],[],zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
ff1eecdd80a1f9b940854cd224a25989 [remove],[],it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
1d9343fe416a6e32f7610f814a6aacc2 [delete],[],if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
c12383bb97c5145343b5078c02d465f5 [control,look],[],the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
b48feb7e6209e47420ac1cab656ae710 [software],[],the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
a88ee172e70d1886ca28bcf0b5ba1d06 [headphone],[],as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
aeaf53d9981fcdae134d914c14c3bf3a [unit],[],overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
3d98a205976ec0e232aa4bcf14021d0b [size],[],this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
b24bda91f521ad2ca3847636eaba7568 [case],[],it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
16ac12ea22acb0865fbe839e4b386158 [cover],[],the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
9875f6fe729cc22fabf62ec61986b351 [price],[],great price .
6d07f4207f4fb66fa8b28f912a9de794 [software],[],i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
7c980ce6e3db331419916b5538ddd428 [scroll],[],the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
ecc2a0ecdcd48e0d7d52b66af830f9f0 [size],[],i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
21ebed2a97f528417ad5da338ef26ef7 [screen,equilizer],[],now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
033b35286cae2ac0ec2fc080f51e500c [weight,software],[],there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
cc2a5126d27ea1de2649523d3ac82c6a [case],[],but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
8121831049060e4e814eb90a284743c5 [price,sound],[],ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
00b26e308a4b8730247f6846646d008a [playlist],[],its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
7967db31bc77438a94a846ddeb630669 [software],[],finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
15d9cf3e39596240efc9e3ba0c79e5a1 [price,capacity],[],* price and capacity
1410831d46d56db6a5d5e35d549b0839 [design,interface],[],* slick-looking design and improved interface
acdaa29179a637e892dd726100d6557b [battery],[],* removable battery
ad71306ca9a64f28e317dd789b8d22d2 [case],[],* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
55dab1cfdddd4a895855e44900c1da52 [scroll],[],* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
ca72c2fb4eef254b80c4d2051a89c457 [eax],[],* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
e781c09e3c443732c8f53703efb0b736 [volume],[],* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
3a0a5560d7bf0fbf314c2dd2947318db [software],[],* software is absolutely terrible :
33f231b9745e1d5d1ef2a29379d0825d [transfer],[],-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
2c56bc9b793294d7e71cb2a6ca92bd76 [recognition],[],-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
b2e9195b55b3d4ac0429cebac50af3a0 [change],[],-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
97e094a508427d2e9e048c7e86aae737 [software],[],-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
3fd077cfdb53680671d6b273e8b56c20 [player,software,rip,transfer],[],a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
ea2c514a36f45b31b1c75ee1b8e84f0b [transfter],[],file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
9a0d7726564146fb03c68fd115bed324 [software],[],my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
ee31d7df41f71e9ae037cdf06e1512c9 [sound],[],to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
1815e3af4f811c08b874fb48013a9edc [eax],[],the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
4571ab0de8e8a459a17e954063b78c9d [navigation],[],navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
d8737e5e75f38be5112109d102d4da02 [player],[],at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
a14a922a3325a69475213f69d9c1a3e1 [use],[],i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
8eb5d2fca4a827e8e326a4df00c9b809 [memory],[],the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
23437ff0a6808a5975343315b39f966d [battery,sound],[],plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
e36d6c54ed710942569ac8dc47ef1c8b [software,case],[],the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
2505b3eb37eb261c8202ec3d03ef5c52 [rip,quality],[],ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
4eb5f2954876bf5f8cf65bf5ee5d832b [player],[],considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
f53180de30a7308dfce4f7c6df47edae [battery],[],first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
700f48300fa8def127637b87e04b7e68 [battery],[],it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
241e92f11d46769e40d74aa4b77795f6 [software],[],the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
4e2e70820a49ac08fe4e3c87254942cf [playlist],[],you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
39cd7109f8321f41f52bb1e4faa244b6 [transfer],[],and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
68dfe1e6439e1d2fafdd1dcf2ce1d498 [sound,volume],[],the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
632c86be964171dbcc6fda361e4135dc [earbud],[],i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
6aed866da58eea721927bebb9ef3ee6e [equalizer],[],i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
f99faf2dfc3e8af6f1f6221e99b19533 [clip],[],however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
dea30bd0a5bde7f25c08bb9e1ae9417a [case],[],also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
e17e18380718fc3b0a9d1deacbd92ff8 [player,software],[],this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
f6f88d89f1bb907351dcee2f580dfcba [stoppage],[],the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
14d20e2bcf29b6bcafa9483b929a2de6 [software],[],1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?

8c911f0be96ba4560218d1f4847f02a8 [storage],[],in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
7ab7a3fdf39cb28801ac1dcd470adf13 [manual],[],but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .

2f4b1a4eefb0c421b14cc034af6fd056 [software],[],given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .

702438ed98f2b97a5f63641e00164027 [construction],[],the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .

6bc32f701b31d3e1398b32992b827143 [mediasource],[],8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).

595586dcd393895e2ca8c8a038c133b3 [folder],[],the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .

fe401e4c7ad5871abaee9660a3bbdd76 [battery],[],possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .

aa040e2aac44669936f89ea50c0ca0fe [viewfinder],[],the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .

7ce68523e9bd23cb9fa8f5c8bfadfa9f [flash],[],the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
f1824e287ef5aafaf050e6870ece87c3 [depth],[],what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
d189707ad42028eec72db14fec45c699 [flash],[],relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
865f5ce19fc754d56e712de777b1bcae [flash],[],contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
20c5a2780290c04a8fff006233aee834 [software],[],now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
c9e60af8c804cc7bc30a164554f7375d [software],[],the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
d94ba22ec1c68f129a09d111449a5e89 [g3],[],what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
38c47be19193cb76675feafd049a684c [color],[],without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
511a23f3a4fe98af1bf9d231291e4dff [g3,software],[],the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
d00579c5aee168118aee6243ff803b1c [software],[],what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .

1f8107d369d0a9aff676c54f789d4256 [automode],[],the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
0c497fa3be9389b212b112840b0bb06e [viewfinder],[],about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .

af189e49f9bda21796bc6e5b42d476bb [picture],[],with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .

51691753f1446ed784e1e75e2da94ffb [lag],[],it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?

a7d8e305d570d95f2e66cc869353dc9a [lens],[],the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .

a4bf04bb2ffffdf15f1e93ccd942ba31 [remote],[],the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
7168bc93960c3ccae9ad72cc71ab956b [battery],[],i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
41d67c7360f1eaff9b82be88ea00f3d7 [manual],[],i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
84224827af1c6fbe4ff62db111e2e0b4 [highlight],[],i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
5a88ccedfd94e24afcf32afe34d0dad6 [body],[],and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
c24124e72afb21806504f88eb5809b93 [download],[],i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .

e30184599d5c95a24e9a14a132efb341 [look],[],the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
861626d0cc4cc5ae19684d4b8d53194c [camera],[],even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .

858a58b51860cbf88e1296d8838558d1 [camera],[],it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
