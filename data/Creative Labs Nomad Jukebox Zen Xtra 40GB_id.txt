708b44f9b368fe9a57d74533f002dd65 [control],[],the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !

04e75cc628aa27f6c3276a1f03b28daa [menu],[],the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
c8a04e62ab057c0a7bce58982ce6cae8 [screen],[],the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .

891f63e1c470263e3ffad09e6a6969b0 [sound],[],on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
20ba4c4b32823c2ce57fa535aeed926f [audio],[],i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .

d2a9bfb1e9ed4d4734bd522814d495e6 [player],[],although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .

c8196ec4c983af49734af374c87665fd [headphone,sound],[],on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !

f2411c8e4e34052a33a2a92ad250283e [zen],[],i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .

5e3b041ac6b9ad8129dd2adbb704bd4e [price],[],the price compared to the ipod is great .
c797f7ccd54badc9e0db79b7ce27861a [price,battery],[],price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
a20c4c03f7b95629a438605bd146c7e8 [itunes],[],but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
66557bcc85255c9c99db64f66a4f71e7 [scroll],[],the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
a12e05ae90f0af9ab3f5d1f078ae000e [software],[],i 've had no problems with the software .

76dae912cf2b027c4d69337edb58cb0f [navigation],[],in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
371fcb1667fb81be4f3ab2087f44f90e [navigation],[],you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .

061fa6633540533196c8541145f80a36 [software],[],so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
0cac93df8a2f02f382f143955f4a4cc4 [zen],[],the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .

00678fc65cf74c7bbfb5bf91f2796a34 [sound],[],the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .

59b4d091b5111df77bfdded1137bcc19 [software],[],software downloads on the site crashed my pc .

3f80b7a14d7a065c04e3f57cdc652c24 [play],[],it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
b54b42cf02a97a211cfa0d30cb043a56 [scroll],[],another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
dea66d5317b71869a95016784c1b70fb [player],[],otherwise , this player is awesome !
22b951ffa2f0d17cc9b029bd85dcdf41 [screen],[],it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
f6623d38bfdb0e14da4f30b48146d4e8 [player],[],overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
44f2a23eb1e67de5a88009265ba81109 [price],[],naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .

fcc6060d8953928ffecfa28e3e7a7871 [screen],[],the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
0d9ef93f4b9430a1a5d9813011b8bc79 [feature],[],there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
4bd98e3804be5a792f3b30af064b63d8 [battery],[],- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
fb3aa19e10f1dae6b9413cfe33af040c [equipment],[],- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .

937380945b7a721b7403148d0d455e73 [player,software],[],the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .

9182663809b6095073a7d5f7266c9609 [player],[],so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
4669d00c8621e9a0281e783c77782dd4 [lcd],[],the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .

ac35a2b46c21e2344be10bb8fcaad509 [eax],[],the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .

b13571b4b8c661704f8e4595b257babc [price],[],lastly , the price is fantastic :

c6f97139fb91a3ccbffcf8da7abc8a93 [recharger],[],and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).

ca693a4c5df2c07f651e149646f822a6 [transfer],[],transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .

513d68e23304b9a241c2496abf036c5b [navigation],[],navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
dfeaf50d5e3cca7bf889853664f868cd [construction],[],cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
0e57ee572cc132a512fea07060c57adf [feel],[],the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
53c7c4556903767966dbc5683f8b126b [feel],[],as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
abb0cfc406cfd076ce7bde7f7535876d [play],[],the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .

6f6b408df12cf2cad628e4ee2887ebd5 [navigation],[],it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
af3486cf11b465100e02244c4ae682ee [control],[],up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
9c8b087ba299dc92014adb3b0c2157ec [case],[],it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
a5a636df118fc8a27663f81f5d541375 [case],[],as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
5fd8c0085bdee242af47218a4dee27e1 [sound,price,player],[],i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
5a2480b407a86683ba7b4076ad5e09f7 [price],[],for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
a5f896d9ee945727e18197eca9a18380 [button,interface],[],the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
80bbb11678af660f0125fc0dd5f8324c [display],[],simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
3d4574448c311e0ea8e5b1e7ad6fcdda [software],[],but the major problem i had was with the software .
b044707a805daadf2f4c1d1c24fefac8 [instruction],[],the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
445b54a1e60413834b2b823f3b73a305 [sync],[],the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
9551fc8f3d50538de5b346accd0212fa [transfer],[],i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
da922c938e7f865a42ddedacb2b59143 [interface],[],i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
a6e8231ff9a167e8b61fd68df9915109 [product],[],i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
911cf34fb4622eb08d94512ab5c12964 [software],[],the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
0a09b863b5f04c01db59378ac1f5c8f2 [headphone],[],the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
a8ca5ff27bcb6526b194c97f24e7c6f2 [navigation],[],took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
4e1901d8d28af75fad800cd14641edc1 [player],[],i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
f6bc4fd24b9be00f5b099c30cab47b22 [product],[],all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
2c92d650e105f7df5d4390b5bddf0006 [look,display],[],it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
01b06273acfb1e183ddcc7f38cb5108c [product],[],i would recommend this product to anyone .
b2d4e633a50cce494eea7a203213e6b5 [player],[],before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
205ba48000827a3b49562499e168cd48 [software],[],many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
8487498f2b6e44dd82814b6515fd3e74 [software],[],the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
44113db332ebb2a7be2326e83dd6db5a [control],[],the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
370f2f08bb8ba98db88f94c031ba3f60 [player,sound],[],the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
08c55a18e9f4a2e76d4f25dff8474868 [battery],[],the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
10d9cee24af6c9f6d40cb101d17311ca [playlist],[],playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
5d8a1adbeeaf90d9f03da0b3810f9ee5 [software,player],[],the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
e3acb2699c9fc9220bd3f2c7f00ad5c9 [navigation,scroll],[],the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
c7593f31f905682ecd393eb33a006c37 [playlist],[],creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
6215fd62148ab8893a49df9183f109ed [eax],[],the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
ada231d490de7ffd5bb32453d86341b0 [product],[],well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
d7971a11f5508d7b68fd3dc153dd2301 [product],[],well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
56b0b55a8c6aba813e567be6d65e17ac [program],[],well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
c88fd1bd55cbc6db568d9d4bfcf9d80b [player],[],not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
4654812eec1f697a9f4ce1e9c75d2a2c [transfer],[],oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
3b783a61d1de4aeff5e2bc59e9014361 [weight],[],a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
6ad951fc0c6d2c701335d2ce44de0d5e [button],[],the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
e4ac12789200e32ecf5a324b1e5e7bb1 [backlight],[],the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
c2d8dd4f0d593e4f1ccb35743b4a76bd [eax],[],my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
c97f7f5032697d824bf0078278432617 [earbud],[],but the earbuds suck !
0995bd9fc59fbcf1a0af1bf0c0da9dce [case],[],i forgot , the case does n't fit .
c990b6b1103f5a85ae4afcfa4dd6d607 [case],[],my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
2f8f641471bc4a57cee5c14765184d56 [sound],[],the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
3e406d6f8231c62cced3fc27d645b1b8 [software],[],what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
7507936ccfd024868889a9ca39083bf9 [bookmark],[],bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
2bfd3a824c2fea33fd6842c8e668b829 [bookmakr],[],rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
398cb319769bddd6c91cb1051d7c2e26 [bookmark],[],this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
77d109e2cb75e81b27de5ba3fb01ee7b [playlist],[],the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
fbfbef5022d2d4b5ac455d2b19cfa830 [nomad],[],i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
bb25f76c14b817eebcf952611ddb3014 [control],[],the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
1245c249dd265d331140ab5a14e99d42 [tag,software],[],my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
aa33d939f98b42cddc9a95271279c4a3 [tag],[],other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
2d3a5b4f342988ecdb571049d90c9e77 [software],[],also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
1ccdd0a015af2bd4872573b4f49a3672 [playlist],[],finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
f047713fd7ebf2002c5bc05f4ab2df80 [software],[],a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
3cb890299f26d6981ec2eb0866b852f3 [sync],[],first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
f8e21ab1b8a57bce5633ca8027b19bb4 [shuttle],[],the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
367132e3bd707c6fcb4fcfefdd6d2de8 [sync],[],second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
43eb564042d7bba0c26ccffc54663aaf [player],[],the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
54724dd286a492837cf9f736f866a74a [software],[],third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
af4ff3b60fd17fb4f6c20eea30e59606 [creative],[],for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
ab5959c7a51807b986ce61bb5891c023 [scroll],[],zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
ff1eecdd80a1f9b940854cd224a25989 [remove],[],it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
1d9343fe416a6e32f7610f814a6aacc2 [delete],[],if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
c12383bb97c5145343b5078c02d465f5 [control,look],[],the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
b48feb7e6209e47420ac1cab656ae710 [software],[],the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
a88ee172e70d1886ca28bcf0b5ba1d06 [headphone],[],as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
aeaf53d9981fcdae134d914c14c3bf3a [unit],[],overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
3d98a205976ec0e232aa4bcf14021d0b [size],[],this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
b24bda91f521ad2ca3847636eaba7568 [case],[],it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
16ac12ea22acb0865fbe839e4b386158 [cover],[],the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
9875f6fe729cc22fabf62ec61986b351 [price],[],great price .
6d07f4207f4fb66fa8b28f912a9de794 [software],[],i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
7c980ce6e3db331419916b5538ddd428 [scroll],[],the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
ecc2a0ecdcd48e0d7d52b66af830f9f0 [size],[],i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
21ebed2a97f528417ad5da338ef26ef7 [screen,equilizer],[],now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
033b35286cae2ac0ec2fc080f51e500c [weight,software],[],there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
cc2a5126d27ea1de2649523d3ac82c6a [case],[],but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
8121831049060e4e814eb90a284743c5 [price,sound],[],ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
00b26e308a4b8730247f6846646d008a [playlist],[],its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
7967db31bc77438a94a846ddeb630669 [software],[],finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .

3a0a5560d7bf0fbf314c2dd2947318db [software],[],* software is absolutely terrible :
33f231b9745e1d5d1ef2a29379d0825d [transfer],[],-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).

97e094a508427d2e9e048c7e86aae737 [software],[],-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
3fd077cfdb53680671d6b273e8b56c20 [player,software,rip,transfer],[],a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
ea2c514a36f45b31b1c75ee1b8e84f0b [transfter],[],file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
9a0d7726564146fb03c68fd115bed324 [software],[],my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
ee31d7df41f71e9ae037cdf06e1512c9 [sound],[],to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
1815e3af4f811c08b874fb48013a9edc [eax],[],the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
4571ab0de8e8a459a17e954063b78c9d [navigation],[],navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
d8737e5e75f38be5112109d102d4da02 [player],[],at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
a14a922a3325a69475213f69d9c1a3e1 [use],[],i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
8eb5d2fca4a827e8e326a4df00c9b809 [memory],[],the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
23437ff0a6808a5975343315b39f966d [battery,sound],[],plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
e36d6c54ed710942569ac8dc47ef1c8b [software,case],[],the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
2505b3eb37eb261c8202ec3d03ef5c52 [rip,quality],[],ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
4eb5f2954876bf5f8cf65bf5ee5d832b [player],[],considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
f53180de30a7308dfce4f7c6df47edae [battery],[],first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
700f48300fa8def127637b87e04b7e68 [battery],[],it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
241e92f11d46769e40d74aa4b77795f6 [software],[],the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .

39cd7109f8321f41f52bb1e4faa244b6 [transfer],[],and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
68dfe1e6439e1d2fafdd1dcf2ce1d498 [sound,volume],[],the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
632c86be964171dbcc6fda361e4135dc [earbud],[],i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .

f99faf2dfc3e8af6f1f6221e99b19533 [clip],[],however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
dea30bd0a5bde7f25c08bb9e1ae9417a [case],[],also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
e17e18380718fc3b0a9d1deacbd92ff8 [player,software],[],this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
f6f88d89f1bb907351dcee2f580dfcba [stoppage],[],the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
14d20e2bcf29b6bcafa9483b929a2de6 [software],[],1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
159b67abc278328bcccc6d17c611028f [mediasource],[],mediasource did not recognize my tags !
c08ea81dfd0032ff6d47afa0112ba4c1 [eax],[],2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
d6255391e01cbaa0b68fdb9cf3e4e183 [eax],[],creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
b45fbddd121d5a06ac46d216611c9b71 [mediasource],[],3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
8c911f0be96ba4560218d1f4847f02a8 [storage],[],in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
7ab7a3fdf39cb28801ac1dcd470adf13 [manual],[],but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .

f17720aeafd313670cd2350bf2e39041 [notmad],[],m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
2f4b1a4eefb0c421b14cc034af6fd056 [software],[],given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
76697d1f74e7bf972afa33e74ab84613 [navigation],[],it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
5713f609f1c720f88066bbaa337daca1 [software],[],the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .

8df2f7ba58c455f15ea3d272c2556f50 [navigation,sync],[],navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .

eab68e8ffd01e853dd876878b35cd2ad [player],[],i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
702438ed98f2b97a5f63641e00164027 [construction],[],the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .

cef7009c693118f1f13f7521c361b2de [construction],[],i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
09d97450c691cb0d4d37880b6dfbc0f5 [installation],[],like other reviewers , installation was hell .
df460eaf582c2debf712f5605d908023 [nomad],[],my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
8854150f66545a6724f8fddff2cfd170 [thing],[],i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
3bf21a4b29d090cbd158c4195701fcd2 [sound],[],1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .

6bc32f701b31d3e1398b32992b827143 [mediasource],[],8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
e9d28867f6cc8362413781bc3fa7002f [sync],[],c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .

595586dcd393895e2ca8c8a038c133b3 [folder],[],the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
673dd22fb3775b937ed0c3edfc1eeeaa [quality],[],but with a low price , comes lower quality .
6bcac49498fd30b88131b83404d6bfaf [price],[],our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .

53300d7a7dd55e15a9b1ca34d833f210 [size,value,design,software],[],in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
ad033c1a3f9aede7296c967e3125b16f [display],[],the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly

fe401e4c7ad5871abaee9660a3bbdd76 [battery],[],possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
60f14cbc1a1f1fba8df34fb32d3b3aa8 [battery],[],since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
78c51d9eb31454b8f9dba754a0353b4b [value,use],[],try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .

c89290e4f08ad015ca64345fd0491bda [build],[],it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
d8012015c19cafbf96cbc6cad5741bba [control],[],i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
549c7d7059064e5d04e7311335d378a8 [screen],[],the screen 's large and easily read .

0a00b74b0ff92b29a1f105bc7d87ff27 [playlist],[],playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .

b7a4b4086ff6f9e114fd0bbca4c9e6cc [player],[],overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
ca88fee0f48f7e3af6abbce6bb924179 [equipment],[],please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .

25da27d72af155af06e6c5874f503ef7 [sound],[],once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
63b191a3a9ad3bc38caa73ddb3d65fb1 [break],[],because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
915a3cd71076181978eeddd26e184a3e [freeze],[],every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
ccccff139fff46b68ee5e5d3b5f6720d [control,software],[],the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
