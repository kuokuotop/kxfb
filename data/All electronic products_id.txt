cd5b349634b4fc9c4d56bec8bf4015ef i ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor
299154a61f199e278648ef719bf92a4a for the price it is a well spent investment
d4aea072a4d82c259b1c6322dc4b650a it s very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set
de26e922f5cfd35c976f25852b35be7d its fastforward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ve had
43bd3fca24e560e70ef752b201fe7025 and amazoncom has it for such a great price  how can you go wrong
52734e430145b0c2c8fc5bb9045f7f8b what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvdrs fill of files  e  mp3s
fc4d099a1153a71bea4c56380ad60ca8 at doublespeed  2x forward speed   it still plays mp3s with sound  they are pitchcorrected and smooth  but twice as fast
fe19754870ba8de34ab8b68d4788bf6a update  the finish is more  mirror  than silver  and i like it
a40a39fa44c86ca04381bee009530f2f many of our disney movies do nt play on this dvd player
c6a83ea9da57eb20f326e6abc581d1df player works and looks great  if you can get the dvd s to play
e7f3ce5f284bb9a7ef6e174c80f700e8 i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this  there is no excuse
a8d92b901f74924149bfabe02f8c52e9 will never purchase apex again
d460f81b43998cfb748cde2be9836aec for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multiformat dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised
f9838d9b72a7789c510f9f1470a3f3a5 then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all
ded43ef4232c5c23698e001714547447 new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays
ea5b53db7c04661245957ff76c2f1b09 i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media
a7b8634eb63de9c056ba583150f2ca48 this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do nt purchase it
70af5f4ccbd91c344f06921f8f150e57 very bad quality
fe7e064c5f0fe9bf989fab990cc0ea99 i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites
013cee43ecda4846af87ce9c321e6494 i took it to my father s house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him
3f04a58bcda5a12c04c16b5a555e8d34 my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money
f79b17a89c5ad1b3a2e790a644f71628 great quality picture and features
3998b3cfdd9be2cd1979133d78106636 nice machines  but i consider their quality pretty low now
c061b6355830cf6ac81be0cb8b239614 the door would not close
5dbe0792295c9820d86841e5c5bb0571 it looks great  and is loaded with features
04401531e9b307a2b46ddd79d8c9ad41 not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it
75a1c2102d97efb4fbb45ac6e92cc92c the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me
03e1cd38959d29902a3f05c616118533 it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time
5a3288ba1d03d602b3367a0c74ac0315 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air
4dd930bcd01ca419dfbadc9a276e001f he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them
9947e0d4813586c77a652fb805fbac2e the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident  it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature  that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cdr data disk without vcd formatting
f01bd384c7ae77d1a2329c0a9d0cd49f the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons
89af97a6226c5a62de6b547c45eae741 i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed
30650f7a1d07890704d95cb9a272243b the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about onequarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings
94eb2a5d54aa0fd7950ffa60bb938a2d it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do
3020d821b551c6b32600053da89f4f37 i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd s  after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it s job
67c8385076080a18316abfe5ca566509 wo nt play a lot of discs
3e4f65f7d84c096fc8a86b3cbf9e09d8 some movies it played yesterday  it wo nt play today
6243125815c5da78dd6e1c10e397dd46 it wo nt play 80  of my movies  which are all store boughten
9151bec746be1369933e0711724fabba the player usually plays dvd s  but has occasional problems such as  1  not recognizing a dvd 2  stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3  not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd
257f0113e671267abaa6f56bd4f6a63a unfortunately it can t play all of the dvd
a3501130193708007cd28c5fd53b8965 on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd
65fa020842bdf7e8d1b730089acf7969 unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could nt play all my dvds  and now the player can t play everything
9606498e6333ccdfc118a265ea813338 we tried it out christmas night and it worked great
6eef518602a7cd948f9f4698d3515a9f even viewed cds full of jpgs
5ebdc26241f99d1ac3b88f4e627fbe24 but when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture
bf1e79759598297ca36cecaaac4165f8 i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone
1a0284a937d6f776c0dd445ba87180e1 we ve purchased 3 universal remotes so farall claiming to work  apex  dvd players and none worked
6e5204af1151707aebba1f5f0526b68d on here of course  also  a couple dvd s would nt play and they were new ones
8a6a1411b8cc32b24107eb3a847bf53d i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective
f96777b605bac7df6334c8ee0c8f6373 i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again
b545dae2cfa2e4679fe9626d77bb6bc1 door broke after a month
e2d322370ca64b148ed382cc9bdc8413 unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs
0faa454c4967e025967b67ee1142b523 well  it was nice while it lasted
b7454b0a15647a8206f34e79352f4291 after  3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds
0d0f8d64973f708c799e4e49d6909dfd it sends discoutinous signals to tv  so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment
52dcfd70b988f7387128d0690c5725e0 the other thing i do nt like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated
e603c6f4fbf730e9d4e0fb6cdebbc90a after hooking the thing up  i found that it would only played less than 50  of the dvds i put in it
ee716d9e4b7b96be567b5ce318f78112 the dvd player just wouldt recognize them
882f8c2afb0b7af577d6c9ab03ee0778 i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed
d1f50b170c43b383723518bc9faf225b because of it s hidden features  no macrovision  nonregional  i keep this baby around to watch nonamerican region dvd s
d1f5cf6191b3c90d8622b5f87670e411 the cool thing about the ad2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd s  dvd    r s
560274a9bead90f84eabdc4ed032b70c it s not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video
b5938c00042cd746390dea8b55ef54ef for the money apex machines have good features
0a3d6bf18633218545bbb81dd93b8f68 it s low profile  space saving design looks nice
ab047c6e984d9cc4e7eef8f6bf293360 same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex  nothing
7f8064a47247d5d7c3d9f96b0cb56d24 i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper
368c413655d2e3b779a34ef7a27efb85 the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 34 of the screen and the image still looked normal
e938caf51ea8e0d24b0f060a2fa90eac loved the slim design
bd4faa5e55cc04220850959d137341d5 audio is excellent
d831e6dfd1d181e2878a4cd115f63f66 i am very pleased with the apex ad2600it plays just about anything you put in the drawer
1b4b8b00a1be6322acc0a3232c0e902d the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used
28d4d1b1a741ac5070c52078b57dd05b this dvd play is basicly junk
192d1feac80f1b657136f3ef38389d3c this is the best dvd player i ve purchased
d8f94f4f264715affd22929f3e2de0be this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price  you can t go wrong
62cf1a8d3b2e903f5a6f46e8d99bb3c2 i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo nt play certain disney and other dvd movies  no disc message
4fb852ec14462e823ccc18ab597d17b6 i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive highend player
80cb6fbb20332fa22c5eba0f351a1901 and the slim formfactor together with the mirrorlike front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey
29d2614f705ec8f146e4eddeb3c87bcf finally  amazon s free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me
684ffae9430925f14cec7dcbe28b19c8 i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts  and both were bad
5a50460035755ae78b5099854653ac30 the first one would nt work from the start
5a15b8f4196aaff0214cee46db5bdc1b the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out
1bb0466c467ad147fa770ae552afdb45 for the most part this is a good dvd player
80a2e096524056f7ac5d85b13f7b69fe but about 25  of dvd s i ve played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments
9cfdc3efb45542494649a4edd3af3cf8 there was neither picture nor sound
de5dc342d4054b1a200ec1a82e9b6b01 we are overall pleased with product
505dde255328ad9519d6f8181477c858 i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual
e4730539ff132950b9f794e6c42e8042 it worked from 1226 to 19 at which time the picture failed completely  see other negative reviewsmy unit was nt the only one this happened to
4e76cc39ae9044560ecd410fbbf8ce76 i tried calling the support number for a week  several times a day  and always got a busy signal
0eb9d14fcd2b19b6fc93f4d30b718c0f neither message was answered  they ask for 24 hours before replying  i ve been waiting 27 days
26b5a2527b86f2059791586f76c6fc5d it only read the dvds 10  of the time  otherwise i would get a no disc screen
559deec06532af818dc647a493e9e9dc progressive scan player for a relatively low price  although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lowerpriced progressive scan players as well
c6d4707ef2fab9972637895ce8590367 seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly  i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise
447f20fd6837855357f840dde335f353 also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds  my old apex ad1200 had trouble with these
89ec4ff01b352ade745a12c65404dee0 output through component connections looks very good  on my nonhd tv
6513c98716058aac2f83fc6564af3fd0 i ve had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players  from friends season 2
972c9a8ae7cdb01c2d55a7fe93e6ecd2 my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units
997d3afc8d64edc1a148be2f556c789c you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll
7c16ca68a8ef98cfd220f1e6c613cf21 also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on svideo  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection  should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv
1f6a9f221bde39b56aa9de7f07074b19 and the remote is cheap and cheasy  not sure how long it ll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck
1884b63b7e64eae77c5a882b7904a99b easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot
f7c6a30b651882d1ae5523552ba03649 i ve attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs  using a multitude of connection methods  and i still can t get a video signal from the machine
c43abed7f15effb4bbf9b56cd5cdb4e1 34 way through the first disk we played on it  naturally on 31 days after purchase  the dvd player froze
a2ba39633cfd1bca8635eeaadeea97ee now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk
0d7130509568edc5932b436be650acad after using it for just a month  i could not play any dvd
a66b194c44c2a5f041dfcb010cfe3532 i can only hear the sound but no picture
2b256f2eeebd9c2eb272bbcf21c261be one of the dvd s i received as a christmas present kept freezing
aec28a98162256e3164389abc0d1370c some dvd s i rented would not play
3cb598830d17cf87874a5a2af03a542e when the player was working it was great but
f7f3873b04f2e4a497667646eb3b0796 it does nt smell like burning plastic when you open the drive
992ba8e6d2465b13f037d361d528c22a without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i ve seen
b1d2c287ea4bba686b01d6ad02db38a0 remote  you can stand it on end  harder to lose   and it s far better designed than the 1100s
650f5a9fc8d23e1f5feb8370e59dc04f first of all  i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed
9b11689d3b0c95dc2f00e7b8943b4934 unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon   my dvd player came in perfect working condition
01bd9627b997fb43d6e384241050849a as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine
726152eaeaf36e106f50419011dfab6a what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds
9bda6f3b3d54d3179789e2d0c3aa99fa for example  i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it
37f15e561ae7ac9028bbedac55bbb567 at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well
328564a122898c77ba7fd6bd1d5f8da8 this player seems to work fine with everything else
9b045c61c91296cac109f652232a84d0 it s running great for all the dvds i have and rented
c65e97e04502114bb0b48321d4f212b8 most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy
1c6d2ae44a6618884b7d5815cc740ab4 i use this with a home theater system and it s amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched
304678fb79adc7d18bc570816e65c16f so much packed in a small case and very affordable
955aeb18a12fd08bf87d4a2dfad715de apex sucks
32ea776ee4efc0b2bbcd509ec2656593 it s a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up
1a75f65daeb3cf2d68dd0dd806a825e8 basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have nt used
5b3429e381941b13bbcb18bc671c6eaf the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good
4eadb02423a841209104f9bbc14fba06 the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that
cbee6021bf2e6de4d5fc0d30431a6bb0 i m giving this player cautious recommendation
9f50c25f5f7fb84cc8995a85ac62697d received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector
85cbc07247c9d953a80e3b0cf102bf7c the remote is a little hard to understand
b111b6d69704c3ae5a4e92f58a249c73 so far the dvd works so i hope it does nt break down like the reviews i ve read
8b1c6a2445c0347cb80255ceb9ad1693 set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week
d15aeb3a555dbb00f357302c32daabc9 there was occasionally a lipsync issue  the lips were nt moving in time to the dialogue
cc85799283131d1b9c5ace392e9fc7b7 but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working
99eba61575e6b77e2206475329ee2445 amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping
861504db448efd462039eef3646bd387 great feature list  poor reliability
2cb1086b096dffabf3ec5cb402e64143 output went black and white only via both svideo and composite connections  and with no vhold
4fe69cda9a1a4c5f33bf92f20dbaf4e0 retraction  said mine had silver plate  it does have display
554c4ad0dd6259a9c61e4817388e8064 the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it  jpeg  kodak pic s and dvdr  i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up
b471b2d427e623361da6a9861a24aef8 ps the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error
3f3779a73e73c8430f134c2c7dca084f forget about the sleek looks if it can t play some of your real dvds
76d840b24bd2063c716af94af9053f6b update  january 27th 2004  the second one crapped out only after a week  dont buy this product
b3d6250f8c0e2d723e032191144e6c20 the player looked good right out of the box  offering lots of features and good styling
44fa354def3a024a49de7a6b055cf68c i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds
3b4fc57da00c1271e4bcb0f82e62fd94 after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available
d92c1f7e4159142d5178f8469f8bd359 only one disk played through to completion successfully
1792df2bfdafa1b8f08a99ebc90380d9 when we tried to hook up the first one  it was broken  the motor would not eject discs or close the door
034391c92fae4d4613f259670a4dc0e4 when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house  that one didn  t work either
9e974418af550929cc2c1482881d2621 imagine my shock  and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex
0bf16d5f06b47eca2b4b60bd737ddf9a the ad1600 did nt work corectly from the start and the ad1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up
5f84086d8d330d61cb3f0c40f5302bc1 amazon is awaesome
7b185dc9dc52f36cb42d1ebf9b7745f6 the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close  a very annoying thing after ahwile
e3ebe7333e6dfe0db5ab794351ccef66 it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice
a7842f2e2a9d2255b9e6cb39ee2886fb and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play
a981acb506188c8737a2ad731e15dfff i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it s nice to know that there re there
0c3dd192dff0c47d17d2b4ed61d35509 the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand
f54e2636edbba92a909eace08e639719 we tried the  finding nemo  dvd and when we got to  chapter 28  the frames started to freeze for no reason
abccd17f9d816346b079fc7aa544ac77 i can t rate it one star only because when it does work it s pretty good
ef8c9c3238c0997f0a50179e0167afa6 only owned it about two weeks so i expect we re looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon
c9abcac1df5d3968c0b2671f58bf3396 the player kept displaying  no disc   so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as
4f137c279c013095e582a54eab397844 besides the one problem  this machine is amazing
3f2d50a7ab8d5ca60ebd9f86781931f9 1  frame freezes and the family yells   dad  somethings wrong with the dvd player  come quick
bbe63f0328f52170d91cf129c76fd211 2  the remote works  but then it does not work  and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong
00551d1526f91ae7108880eca085b00c finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600
cc11c712dec9b78a5e6186104998785b one still works fine  the other quit after one day
69ded3dab3f77a5cae0dc1ee1928aae0 owner s manual has substandard troubleshooting guide
74f5e24e9641d9668bffdc61cfcfa718 the dvd player is fine
6e605a7e27c3d4ecb6182473f750fb9f the picture is perfect  although i m not watching on an hdtv
31aa5c3f5d31378b6c3d2a52028a86f5 but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there
542d552b6a80169971106c0493d88457 when i hooked it up it only produced sound  a cd played fine  but with a dvd i only got the audio  no picture
eaf28814dbb3074b0659f527029d3186 seemed like a good deal  but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds  takes a long time loading and then concludes   no disc
499db2ac0845c79245f70ba7c8bc100b first  the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds
48452b00f56fb6ca13348ad1d92debd5 the remote is flimsyfeeling and awkward to use
8ba70e597cfc6e241555d687623ddb4e in addition  it only seems to work if you re about five feet away from the player  although that may have been just the batteries that came with it
ac784394d0d8b253878624ada2154654 the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough
521121be8f6569821c970c8fc219b7d7 it played only one out of three dvd s without problems  the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches
9c5252c44d1ab48d1e562937f43ffc12 both of the problem dvd s would repeatedly freeze during playback  while the counter on the player kept going
8dca0b9f08fdb7c46061d68705889afb one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu
625d471844b0c4831e1c2656db644042 the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed
84b3210547b32bd5ab20ec53b3438380 there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote
9982cf025cf09cf43f1be57afa09155b all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift
2025b4edf2d69fbd4b39760b1f763881 i was impressed by this very inexpensive playerfor the first three hours  and then it died
d8105077a4434e718fee25bbe1966b63 i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category
51852e0480cd7ec9f0c69cb3d7012a3b there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open  my prev machine did it automatically   and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance
e84bda7445af61e44a722324fcdbccf7 still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features
07832c69663afb284da4ae0d63bcc64b i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes
3ea5962d4e53b81077f68cb9fa6cd4b0 unfortunately  the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way
e1fa274c45a3d786c5a8eef4ad84ec31 i called apex s support number numerous times but it just kept ringing
83e9f5a06e9e14fe2fc55a1563f15ee0 ability to play most discs  i tried dvd  vcd  dvdr  audio cd and it played all
b1ebe13ded22c85b218f059ffd618f4a good looks
168375c1396ae73de3fde98510ddc928 the build quality shows why its so cheap  small scratches on the base plate  something that you would nt see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
bf481030e644dc8ef932d183242a13dd this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player
fcc77a7acb16badcd209eeeef55a9e9c i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it
291b89defbbe4a497ff51c7d8d63f47c apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players
cf747929cdd68c4ba428097b0cf1e56a also  very light and portable
a594ce84433d4c898f581803a652ab4c the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc
c82e6d350f624f918e300fffbbcad423 it will read and play all cd audio disc
eaa7bd673796d9bd7a28be3b08a90c63 i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far
2bde27ec076a78d9ec7c4cd85403b097 however  it has failed to deliver on quality
a6a630f2c2b2c25834e78ab16528f156 it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs  it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies
5af90fdafd59b525226aefa2ffc9fd00 i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand  but with my experience and reading the other reviews  i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product
805fb64ce9cfd89eb965b553110a9c78 it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs
91e28925c3f898f27b3023291ecee22e however  it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips
a8ace68534381de6693b2cd4a413efea also  it was only  3999  after rebate  with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player
d971ba472d37cee787a974beea87a655 can t say whether i rec d an  updated  model but it will not read dvd  rw s or vcd s for me
b04a1b6bbf5356e9d6ebf7e31273b479 it did play a dvdr which was unplayable in my older philips machine
2359d422951fd48bbe8711993ef70ada mixed bag i guess but the price was right
cd704648bf583767f520f7800329f7ce this is the third apex product i ve bought and they continue to impress for the price
63310a5e17e811681d048ee50bff3ac2 the build quality feels solid  it does nt shake or whine while playing discs  and the picture and sound is top notch  both dts and dd51 sound good
61b0cbdba9d3d1062735828f148c2ac5 i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did
e831e965366d5a0aac3ac4e17d514a91 i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have nt had any problems
eb49671e2b0f5b54b7dfefe2d8de0a1b there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture  zoom etc
a5a333667ea01279e3392a1206408e0b noiseless  lightweight and oh yeah
0bd186f76e74c82503b313c048781adb works great
6d685a8248c25916f3c4493aec1d226c silverish color really adds a special touch
f8e8b06b80ac0d9f1a09a6206e2b31a3 it plays just about any format  check before you buy if it plays yours
7c56e1066942129bcbd2cfaf542d75a8 either way  can t go wrong with this price
cb2481936526033884407b90cc7ee91a for instance  i made several backups of my dvd movies using dvdr  w  and  r  w  and it plays the dvds
ab1c9dcd2760939fe9998b9e2d3355b0 no matter the format
9a1063a3c621fc3e1daeb5407582a281 while  there are flaws with the machine  the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability
ef25a24c12ae7b697445f8d181fbe847 like it s predecessor  the quickly revised nx  this player boasts a decent size and weight  a relativelyintuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags  and excellent sound  widely known to be better than ipod  not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business
009a83596167fefb74ee4f99f3da73be the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger  nowblue backlit screen  which is infinitely better
03570c7476d0ceac93f46ac37f238d57 i chose this one because from what i read  it was the best deal for the money
ec3e6b247f6122e9e8e67e6c3e169ebc the software is great
57033fc830bf16bf7d5880910f3510c6 transfering is easy  the software makes everythig pretty easy
15a7c1725a6f3133066f8d0f949ee8de only 1 problem  no accessories  yet
415686bffcb3cfc6ca44c45ef701e46f i hope it s because it s new and they are not out yet  but being without a remote is hard
41fb201e96b0a4471c1d5968f0e2bbed they player s interface itself is also very easy to use
a47093dc8287a8f274c8d63c78ce45d1 software is easy to use  although redhat software is better  but costs money
4609198e9495aeb97d0e1704b1f11136 much cheaper than ipod good looking player  beautiful blue backlit screen  if you ve read about the player  some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on  but this is good because the face does nt get damaged  scratched fast transfer rate
d0b9db1d064aee4b746b67671efad50e you re going to need to buy new headphones  the stock ones suck
2f0c579001ddf9a71892e54a7ae11a15 the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s
21324ba4087ec89d5867ec3d3cbed878 navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well
f44741557e15a6d5aa4732d78cf51b01 at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod
50815ed54fda64a996bb08d62d2a7a46 the battery is replaceable  a real plus  and there is a leather case  another real plus
d774bf064dcc434889cc18e434544697 so far the software for the pc works easily
0aa7689b258533c7181e112c5660d045 by the way  it looks nice also
9f6a7f7178e78442ace2e798b1feb157 my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price  i found both
e9085eaf184831b80aff2166379e289a the sound is excellent  but a tip  get a real pair of headphones
708b44f9b368fe9a57d74533f002dd65 the controls are on the side instead of on the front  which i like  because that s where my thumb is when i hold the thing
6a8f21acd626d0800eee6c1da079d11a it could be a little bit bigger  but it s easy to get used to
97de56d8b2c770f71d198ee46e6dacfb the screen may be a little smaller  but it is very readable and does nt come in the overused blue
c35cec64272467bc85a2e0ad72807549 it does nt have firewire  not a real complaint since most windows users do nt generally have firewire cards themselves
046321e6f46dfb8659079eb3d885696d other plusses  changable battery  loads of presets for environments  decent construction  still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod
c17dc1715e1475263f7052f45d238a95 overall  small  sounds great  and less expensive than apple s overpriced ipod
2781ec21a03150c5581bbc9dcb056d24 batteries last longer too
93b83dad8de467af70db727ec3d5cebc the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the ipod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay  300 for this great player
24abd4ca4b2e2dd4bcb7e9533280f5ce i ve had it for about 2 weeks and it s the best player i ve seen  and used  ever
04e75cc628aa27f6c3276a1f03b28daa the music is easy to get to  all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of ipod owners say  and if you know how to search for an artist by name online  then you can do the same with the zen
c8a04e62ab057c0a7bce58982ce6cae8 the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night  but dim enough so it does nt blind you when you stare too long
68a9b8ffda36ad44922fd9094de3d7c5 all in all this a great player that blows the ipod away  with easy to use and understand features  software that is simple to understand and use  and a great sound  which is all that matters in a mp3 player
afaf39071b52683e17764f148e9d31e2 it s a very intuitive program
6ae486eab43b12fc48eb5ebd137a031d i had no problems following their installation instructions
505eef725abd66a7fe0622b6840e6127 the menus are very easy to navigate
2bf6cfc96b5bc5542cd4ad34261974e3 the other controls are all very easy to use
d8fbb9053ab6bfa846842cec9c7375ac the only downside i see is that it does nt look like you can manage playlists from the nomad  it has to be done from the computer
c6a901cdd637a0656a4f254ad26c16e2 the earbuds that come with it are nt that bad
366990c55e8589617438949b2756f2f4 this is a good deal for music and data storage
27f13efb1c6d5d29bb29db0c4901feed the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software
5d8092a6d765cfc489d62935e6d8fd12 the interface software itself  which should be userfriendly  was anything but easytouse
781e98709ecc8a7dfab7d9011bee8474 the player itself has all sorts of problems
a8ab51fb70878af0b625fce02e4bfcdf the scroll button is overly sensitive at times  not sensitive enough at others
b4c4b96fd48905f15ca7fc99ac5c6ff1 depressing the scroll button  for selecting  is not always responsive
9b424d6365bac0f4f17ad2c4236e8f08 the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating
891f63e1c470263e3ffad09e6a6969b0 on the positive side  the sound of the player is pretty good  once you have everything configured
20ba4c4b32823c2ce57fa535aeed926f i have nt had time to really push this player to the limit  but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory  as should be expected from creative labs
b30b5b6479f3c4d4f013169b4b75028b overall  a very disappointing product
65d57e5a4311b045168d50ce95763aa8 the setup process for the nomad is infuriating  and the interface with the player is subpar
64af7a62dcc6e958a42efdd79f3bff12 the player s mechanics are also flawed
d2a9bfb1e9ed4d4734bd522814d495e6 although the soundquality is good  it takes more than good sound on a portablemp 3 player to result in a good product
7b7d04dd9eb17d5a2a93e72824918ba3 when it came down to it  the price on this player is hard to beat
779a3476686e17329f2fc937f7fa7b1d one beef is the scroll  it does nt work as well as i d like
65b5c536d6d91c394bc8b7ba532235ab zennx s replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod
ead02770ba3fff710bbb69f23f20558b the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery  just like any other batterypowered appliance
1be79d7a5a11f8412ca2fbc51b782117 deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rdparty earphones   20   and software   25
3a7359c228b14d5af1256761b5c276f0 the bluescreen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement  but the toggle switch is still tricky
66ce466af1383f7ed6c6c49cbf3bf433 i love my new nomad  its great
ad451383a8f52970863fb60b1cd69f44 for some this might be a problem  but for the price of a 30 gig ipod  you can get a 60gb nomad  the ipod simply pales in comparison
f339b39fbea7fe7baa1418d143d3cfae the software is very easy to use  and within 30 minutes of opening my box  i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds
8a31ba51febce8f3d665f6e34835eb2d the free  i didnt know they still did that  carrying case is really protective  and to me its the only accessory you need  except good headphones
c8196ec4c983af49734af374c87665fd on the subject of headphones  this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box  but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof
eec2ea24e9d430dfa7c739b7564618f7 but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player  get the nomad
6bff76f5401264648b027c7bc10b42de all the buttons  neccessary lil  gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand
4fb822aa6d5fcde57fa8d260e22a9770 navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch
f1d894ebed14f332b5be805d716739ef also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player
7f29f0fe969c8fc60fdc28661dd9739a i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up
f1ec074964c5a280f73dfd66022b0269 i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player
782fc2a612ee16ef9a514ec7e35802b2 getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience
fcd373c9245e6cf2b0b35bf8a793932b also  the instruction manual is very bad
d3ce1590bf181d8757fe6b288af73a66 i have no complaints with this mp3 player
d3d0480db545710bfeb04f0a7e77e30c then sorting the files is easy as pie
ba92443cb9a6e3b3c3a9255183b1c671 also  the sound is wonderful  my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with
dda5363374c02d2557ecec9085e01651 the battery is nice
80e11640737e6ee1cc2902f3c818c14c the lcd screen was very large and readable
b4710055bc1a10f777d1a193f72ef944 compared to everything else in this category  this is most definately the best bang for the buck
f2411c8e4e34052a33a2a92ad250283e i gave the zen 5 stars because it s excellent for the class that it is in and it s not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class
cbaec5e1d5d11423c1b9022283a65123 transfering  i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 11 or 20
0f2374d58e39320546bc65d19df970fa it would only transfer 30 or so songs  and then come up with an error
03f1651d264a21651b42a1041db57dbb size  bigger than the ipod
87c5b70d46d6b4cb5476f4a5c2192289 software  music match jukebox is nt the greatest  the search funtion is nt fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut
7dc900e5981655de08215321d314835d i love this player
c7f5cceaff97a5d0b302626a5fbb9eca i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again
d81555f22735886788ea73f1132e3c36 the software was great  as long as you have an adminstrative user account  windows xp
9b386fcefb830e15c2600e5d99a60f18 anyway  this player is a great deal and i really love it
074a0ef9795ec5883cc9095904d96eb4 first  the cons  a tad bulky  not the most asthetic looking player  and does nt support a folder stucture
4d8ad44b1b14c1b2e414992de2d17bbd i find it pretty easy to use  and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx  on the pc
ab72638a942345b2a65db3fe67536bb1 not counting the time i spent editing the songs  i suppose i should ve done it anyway on my pc  the transfer was pretty painless
341900728bdf68f6d26118c42768752f ripping  transferring tunes is basic  and pretty fast  even on a 11 usb
b6ad3734805d45028aacb33df91f1f38 people also have complained about the case not having a window  but that s not really a big deal to me either  the case is sturdy and offers very good protection
26afbb728550c0df1149e771bc94d54b the sound quality is excellent  and i m fussy with that stuff   the unit looks cool  screen is bright and easy to read  and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod  besides the price  but everyone knows that
68a8302a084952a7e1cf8fe9f3f14b4e you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well  sound presets  navigating options  playlists  etc
f57610696a8c7bcfd48e157cbef09feb the only thing i m concerned about is the quality  longevity of the buttons on the thing
fc1353a755e02d2292608b3ddaa8e8fa my  fast forward  button works  but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go
2e9c5b1a86f4dbb60d971706c9a6303a all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well
8b9a6cd9df31ff13ae9cf191b5e2455f but i ve already emailed creative tech support about it  and gotten timely responses  they will fix it for me if necessary
9cad5736da827e5d496c2741b7aabcef sure  it s a little bigger than the ipod  but not by much
7c5f2cad9e33dd876fe73ed5afd2c719 it still fits in the palm of your hand  and it s not heavy
25d13607a3d0abce285789e09dc8ffa6 bottom line  great product  unbeatable price
5fb4b81a32ad9a445d62d0a28c23a37a the setup and transfer process was cake for me
d640dd60fc3c00a06110c0f4bb84347e the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did nt have to reboot the computer or anything  just open up explorer again
83c0f79f8710192a88e6b91256723401 the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well
f0c0c8d21d612bb7b910accde1d355fe now that i have all my music on it there has nt been any more problems
6d0ac44003c8f03b17f4e1adcc23e886 the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it
fd02adeb0b3e3ad869f3f15173d5cd41 i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic
953d167adfbea5165b5b374987f15397 i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver
467f423739211c9d00072d3a6f9764e5 i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy
9125350c090c470cfd3f5084ef7365fb ripping your songs and creating playlists could nt be any easier
a02886b0e5a359523dc0cef529ff0f68 i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer
adc10873dc7b8afd51047d4c479e2e65 actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated
ea4fb8598a87486371fe751a009ec959 finding a particular song  s  or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy
814a355a03cfe25a41d31293be549801 the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight
f7e215562ee1a9103ae0258748c464f7 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use  hardware and software   playback quality and value for the price
0e5f67b050553dd76a766dd94211c505 nice palm sized unit  somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you re not going to try  jog with it or something
4445ba29ed92b3fd3c0b931e302ac58a the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative
b2c12395e7baa4db094eb94137f35655 i ve tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it  it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio  but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment
a38439d7c15e4548fd748f4b11dd2e65 the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones
45609991a6c8a115b87b71d4c3620b77 the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
feb7dcbbee6a06823c848eca7460da73 included creative software is pretty poor
867804e0f600290b55597fc61d92689b great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
c2c86cf57832cdfe9528c3894a413821 best in class sound
7491b52ccd6cdf7fb6cb7dd33913b3c3 large easy readable screen
eb7618dbcb52171ae616abad1d389f2c i tried to play the song three times  with no success
f40793c38a74c3360a2488bb5907dc28 it would either not play the song at all  or skip wildly  no matter that the unit was resting on my desk
913332dbee7c09d79b4e2d89d50983e3 had there been strange noises  or obvious defects  i would have accepted a replacement  but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches
122cfd2b8bf7fbd7aa5e8c6241d5400f i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd s transferred
0bc7e90c6f8562629f5338ddab065f25 however  the creative software is not real intuitive
4b6a08ee430cea6d15e1cd66fb525897 the software is somewhat nice to look at  using it is not the easiest
3c5f59db1e69e2a5265fc983a5c721dd if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred  you will become frustrated quite quickly
927a14f889b6993f5079b0034e9837d6 transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 20
b7417a11cf288e47a567e3ecde685427 it is great sounding  even with the supplied earbuds
042d659e2571a54ac6dd267df5c94471 i must have differing preferences than others here  as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony s that i thought sounded good on other players
918de59c61c94ae7c7291788af1fdf09 i love the storage in this thing
4b422478d2bfe45105ae6e24c6b27e46 the interface used could be better designed
9d2b6df35824844c6e9e5f23b3c8b700 and the case  how did this ever make it out of quality control
d65b4f9868df8c7ec371d1551ba95d22 the cutouts for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls  especially the scroll wheel
79c1116733a016587698daee6f3b36a7 quite simply  the firmware and  or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time
dddabe0a6ff5deb6dc9e3641be46c42d i know this unit will have problems in the future and the  40 for the 2 year  no questions asked  replacement warranty will be worth it  since creative will only warrant it for 90 days  which in itself is totally ridiculous
381645b8c5e4a5a766692ae2bb576665 this is my second creative labs mp3 player  and it is definitely a fine product
f041070426ec31a080e77c74f9f5ee0c 1  the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod  and it weighs a little bit more
2e09cd1f8010f95983f90fce20da6fe7 2  the scroll button is nt the best  as it sometimes can be hard to select
cbfc89f77439980882d812d4eb68bc5b the player s software is very easy to use and very good
ec45f347a448e896c123cf2716a5bcba compared to musicmatch  the software has a better filing system and easier to use
e74da56b82a743addc4bc80ccd353906 this thing seriously is a good player though
25a208137ef94897495c53c7c6c312e9 overall i like the unit
1e394b3a762361b846c8fb74a2f0ab0d 1  price  gb of storage
40a8c57eae2ae7248199788fc78077e8 2  storage capacity
5c950f0f68fa5bf13fbe33d9b8b6c3c8 3  user replaceable battery
959602bf89ca279673672e006f510673 2  scroll button  switch
daafc75e6bcd6fce195af9664df50625 3  the case hides the display  you have to open it to see what you are doing
70bd3a733134156690cb111c55c3822f the storage capacity is great
5e3b041ac6b9ad8129dd2adbb704bd4e the price compared to the ipod is great
c797f7ccd54badc9e0db79b7ce27861a price  along with the replaceable battery  which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace  as well as the hassle of returning it  were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad
a20c4c03f7b95629a438605bd146c7e8 but for now it appears that this player does nt play well with itunes
66557bcc85255c9c99db64f66a4f71e7 the scroll bar is a bit of a pain
a12e05ae90f0af9ab3f5d1f078ae000e i ve had no problems with the software
63b8144d6c2c174572bc050cfbd0ae2f the software comes with plenty of defaults genres
1275816028be42ce14dd06e59b53b586 the sound from the player is ok
7514d5166ea3e0be58f2730e04aeb499 i was a little disappointed in the low end
622d2b0a51584ebe2c7e4f21d9ba1330 the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected
20f7e57ebd6596546f8333a55a35a444 one good thing  it is 40 gb of disk space  well  it is 38 gb in reality
4f24be526a9c92068894b12a0079407e for the price and features it is really good
76dae912cf2b027c4d69337edb58cb0f in any case  navigation by artist  album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders
371fcb1667fb81be4f3ab2087f44f90e you even can not navigate by genre  artist  album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre  no other division
aa755efa485b6b2983cdb9916e3def2b the software  which comes with player is not good at all
061fa6633540533196c8541145f80a36 so yes  as with all software bundled with creative products  it was useless and ugly
0cac93df8a2f02f382f143955f4a4cc4 the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks  spills my beer  but does nt wash my car
3eab72409ccff3c92556a10118277041 i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it
00678fc65cf74c7bbfb5bf91f2796a34 the sound is excellent  the battery life is excellent  the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent  and finally the price   200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod  is excellent
9b738839dfbee4e8db71a1dba60aa00b the nomad is not ugly  it is not that big  it comfortably fits in my pocket  or heavy  and the controls are not hard to get used to
b9063ee5751791fa6c9c7c2cfb04d687 b  the screen is hard to read  the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
8e5d48144e2352fd121ac7d430fcfb1c c  the scroll bar is a travesty  enough said
2155dae2420356df58f64bd1e973732d d  software is another great misfortune  hard to operate  crashes frequently  screwed my music library up  doesnt work with mp4s  the list goes on and on
7dced1d79c48c3ee36577dd998895d1a e  the case is too small  it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
53a91a3802fc40bbba3c21c7e9355215 f  it doesnt look pretty  spending this kind of cash  you want something that has the asthetics bit down  of course
2bbf8f59d3110e4a4954aca45035a23a the software failed repeatedly
59b4d091b5111df77bfdded1137bcc19 software downloads on the site crashed my pc
7c2743ecc6a2c318b795bd38984a1f6b i just bought this player today and i already love it
3f80b7a14d7a065c04e3f57cdc652c24 it has a few inconveniences  one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd
b54b42cf02a97a211cfa0d30cb043a56 another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long  it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on
dea66d5317b71869a95016784c1b70fb otherwise  this player is awesome
22b951ffa2f0d17cc9b029bd85dcdf41 it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily
f6623d38bfdb0e14da4f30b48146d4e8 overall  this player is awesome and i definately recommend it
44f2a23eb1e67de5a88009265ba81109 naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing  i recomend wwwnomadnessnet   and pricewise zens are unbeatable
f685a3a0947843463825e1bb031ce248 compared to other leading hdd mp3 players  the value per gb is the tops
2af163caa9d46e522b350f3b11f88a74 uploading music is quick and easy
fbee1b6fcf7db29b9cb6d9e03ae53a38 although the supplied software can be annoying at times  on whole it is excellent
268205ed2adbfd7633dfbe6593bf4edb the unit itself its well structured  with just the buttons you need and none you do nt
4da67439931b4151fac755d4b598dfbc as often mentioned  the scroll tab is average  however  not difficult to use or horrible
fcc6060d8953928ffecfa28e3e7a7871 the screen is large  defined  and easy to read  and the silver unit is naturally cool
0d9ef93f4b9430a1a5d9813011b8bc79 there are lots of interesting features included such as eax  and customization
4bd98e3804be5a792f3b30af064b63d8 the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out  as all lithium batteries do   you will be able to buy another easily
fb3aa19e10f1dae6b9413cfe33af040c equipment included is average  but that is nt a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for
e1ad1a34c613db2ca633d3d78e5f2be1 the case is strong and stylish  but unfortunately lacks a window  now a big deal
c086e6c5bbd8763f8374f31de758012d the headphone earbuds are average  so just use your regular pair instead
995acd474024ab5500649725d2b02aae this player is an ideal purchase
937380945b7a721b7403148d0d455e73 the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt
98403a16cdeed60e2113243a13b306bf i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player
a361394cdc6999e5a0fe06836b4e3951 on my main computer the software did not work right
25e9ac3314edbb22f429a90632829517 i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic
9182663809b6095073a7d5f7266c9609 so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost
4669d00c8621e9a0281e783c77782dd4 the lcd is larger than the previous model  the nx  and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx s green backlight did
a0025c0db7ea0540259cd3b1b90d7fcb the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product
ac35a2b46c21e2344be10bb8fcaad509 the included eax support is useful at times  especially when you listen to a variety of genres  as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle
3d5f68099b5d17b2d10ecc955837f5ab the software has nt been a hassle for me at all
b13571b4b8c661704f8e4595b257babc lastly  the price is fantastic
1e7796b52864f44323808bc0290064a3 i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes  no crashes or problems
c90109759bcc96a15bb07eb055a6fef8 yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap  replace them
de8c0ea32caab8f743c60c243bf98ff9 but the sound is very good  and loud  and works well on my portable speakers
c6f97139fb91a3ccbffcf8da7abc8a93 and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world  and is quite small
381e0bc5add64324e7dea05c1857140f it looks very cool  and seems quite small to me and very light
2cb65646de9a97d0b4b05d72225ee6af the scroll button seems ok  i have no problems with it
839017bf38fa97672e96ca48c5695a3a very simple to use
534cc711fb7497cc8a9f2de24a929ac6 1  a spare battery would have been great
ec0fd99b6bcbfe936b9599e58eacb322 2  no games  it has a cool screen  why not use it
1d1779b5fd4631148758949a356271bc 3  it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer  like some players
98cbbe99adab2c7b6c6ec4ace851e125 all in all suprisingly easy to use
5a9e2c56b3e4e5359842e5b8ef87d675 lots of flaws  but exceptional sound quality  hd size  and price make it a good buy
8569a7dfb307c605d7ba9f01dc118762 excellent sound  i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox
ca693a4c5df2c07f651e149646f822a6 transfer through windows explorer  windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk  so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad
d9373416910359b8a385ab071d81a693 i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer
1a660d93ab7bcfe1d1d3d39c1c3b80e0 huge storage space  even at 320kbs  you can store a ton of songs on this thing
b3664a72fc3d4305b40c634c0706c9c0 having usb 20 makes for very fast transfers
513d68e23304b9a241c2496abf036c5b navigation system  the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs
dfeaf50d5e3cca7bf889853664f868cd cheap construction  they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners
0e57ee572cc132a512fea07060c57adf the player feels very delicate  as if i m holding an actual hard drive
53c7c4556903767966dbc5683f8b126b as a portable player  it should feel a bit more durable
abb0cfc406cfd076ce7bde7f7535876d the songs do nt play one after another like on a cd
1570c8057aa673cb966b476bc21d70b2 software  the software is crap
08ab613078229543daf0da24f79ad268 even after reading some of the instructions  it s still hard to figure out
d92ad8231981f8b3759771615f2c7a6e controls are a bit awkward
b306d893d4abfe8c7f979a77cfff7a5a crappy headphones
0474d0b6a9b1c4f3d8293ffb0fbdcf6b the included earbuds were uncomfortable
8aa5d60d1152572e6165890c76430ad6 difficult navigation  i wo nt necessarily say  difficult   but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate
6f6b408df12cf2cad628e4ee2887ebd5 it is a bit cumbersome  and i can t get to the songs i want as quickly
af3486cf11b465100e02244c4ae682ee up  down  left  and right would have given me better control
9c8b087ba299dc92014adb3b0c2157ec it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen  and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack
a5a636df118fc8a27663f81f5d541375 as it stands now  the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel  or if you load up all your songs beforehand
5fd8c0085bdee242af47218a4dee27e1 i am willing to overlook it s problems to get superior sound quality and low price  although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement
5a2480b407a86683ba7b4076ad5e09f7 for the price and size and features  you can t beat the price
a5f896d9ee945727e18197eca9a18380 the buttons and interface are very easy to use
80bbb11678af660f0125fc0dd5f8324c simple click buttons  back buttons volume and display are very easy to read  access and use
3d4574448c311e0ea8e5b1e7ad6fcdda but the major problem i had was with the software
b044707a805daadf2f4c1d1c24fefac8 the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple
445b54a1e60413834b2b823f3b73a305 the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful
9551fc8f3d50538de5b346accd0212fa i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused
da922c938e7f865a42ddedacb2b59143 i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer
a6e8231ff9a167e8b61fd68df9915109 i have had no problem whatsoever with this product
911cf34fb4622eb08d94512ab5c12964 the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine
0a09b863b5f04c01db59378ac1f5c8f2 the headphones are nt the best  but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity
a8ca5ff27bcb6526b194c97f24e7c6f2 took me a few tries to get use to the navigation  but it s a very user friendly player imo
4e1901d8d28af75fad800cd14641edc1 i have nt messed with the firmware at all  the player worked perfect for me right out of the box
f6bc4fd24b9be00f5b099c30cab47b22 allinall  this is another excellent creative product
2c92d650e105f7df5d4390b5bddf0006 it s small  light and nice looking and the display is decent as well
01b06273acfb1e183ddcc7f38cb5108c i would recommend this product to anyone
b2d4e633a50cce494eea7a203213e6b5 before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one  and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it s the best one out there
205ba48000827a3b49562499e168cd48 many people have written about the software being its one downfall  personally i have nt had a single problem with the software  i m running windows me
8487498f2b6e44dd82814b6515fd3e74 the software runs smooth  it s nice to look at  it s very organized  easy to follow and makes things very simple
44113db332ebb2a7be2326e83dd6db5a the controls on the player are very simple  no need for a manual
370f2f08bb8ba98db88f94c031ba3f60 the player is fast and sounds great  it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music  or making it sound like you re hearing the music in a huge auditorium
08c55a18e9f4a2e76d4f25dff8474868 the battery lasts very long when playing music  but writing files to the player drains the battery fast  so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files
10d9cee24af6c9f6d40cb101d17311ca playlists can be made on the fly  without aid of a computer  and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your  now playing  selections or playlists
5d8a1adbeeaf90d9f03da0b3810f9ee5 the software could nt be better and the mp3 player works like a dream  i could nt give this anything but a 5  i wish there was a 6
e3acb2699c9fc9220bd3f2c7f00ad5c9 the navigation is nice enough  but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks  hundreds of albums or artists  or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving
c7593f31f905682ecd393eb33a006c37 creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was nt as easy as i would have liked
6215fd62148ab8893a49df9183f109ed the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq
ada231d490de7ffd5bb32453d86341b0 well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket
d7971a11f5508d7b68fd3dc153dd2301 well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player  at that size and the price
56b0b55a8c6aba813e567be6d65e17ac well just one con  its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it  it will be a breeze
c88fd1bd55cbc6db568d9d4bfcf9d80b not only is it more affordable  but its a better player for windows  which is what i have
4654812eec1f697a9f4ce1e9c75d2a2c oh  and file transfers are fast  easy
3b783a61d1de4aeff5e2bc59e9014361 a little weighty  9 ounces  no biggie   but otherwise fine
6ad951fc0c6d2c701335d2ce44de0d5e the buttons are easy to use  and its easy to navigate
e4ac12789200e32ecf5a324b1e5e7bb1 the big backlight makes things easy to see  and the writing is big enough for people to see
c2d8dd4f0d593e4f1ccb35743b4a76bd my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature
c97f7f5032697d824bf0078278432617 but the earbuds suck
0995bd9fc59fbcf1a0af1bf0c0da9dce i forgot  the case does nt fit
c990b6b1103f5a85ae4afcfa4dd6d607 my case doesnt close  maybe mine was just faulty  but the case isnt that great
2f8f641471bc4a57cee5c14765184d56 the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad  but still rather larger than i had expected
3e406d6f8231c62cced3fc27d645b1b8 what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software
7507936ccfd024868889a9ca39083bf9 bookmarks for example  are an excellent feature  but not on this player
2bfd3a824c2fea33fd6842c8e668b829 rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area  the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made
398cb319769bddd6c91cb1051d7c2e26 this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks
77d109e2cb75e81b27de5ba3fb01ee7b the dynamic playlists   now playing   i belive creative calls it  feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate
fbfbef5022d2d4b5ac455d2b19cfa830 i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now  and i am very happy with it
bb25f76c14b817eebcf952611ddb3014 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod  but i have gotten use to them  and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price
1245c249dd265d331140ab5a14e99d42 my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software
aa33d939f98b42cddc9a95271279c4a3 other tagging problems result  i think  from the nomad s operating system
2d3a5b4f342988ecdb571049d90c9e77 also  i can t understand why the software does not ignore  the  when it lists the cds in alphabetical order
1ccdd0a015af2bd4872573b4f49a3672 finally  making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually  and are organized by cd  which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order
f047713fd7ebf2002c5bc05f4ab2df80 a lot of people complain about the creative software  but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes
3cb890299f26d6981ec2eb0866b852f3 first  the zen lets you sync to more than one computer
f8e21ab1b8a57bce5633ca8027b19bb4 the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources  you can t do this on the ipod  except for a cumbersome workaround using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player
367132e3bd707c6fcb4fcfefdd6d2de8 second  the  automatic  sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer
43eb564042d7bba0c26ccffc54663aaf the zen serves as a backup device as well as a player
54724dd286a492837cf9f736f866a74a third  creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer
af4ff3b60fd17fb4f6c20eea30e59606 for those of us that like to tinker  i think creative offers some advantages
ab5959c7a51807b986ce61bb5891c023 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player
ff1eecdd80a1f9b940854cd224a25989 it also lets you remove songs from the play order
1d9343fe416a6e32f7610f814a6aacc2 if you bring up an album  but absolutely hate some of the tracks  the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order
c12383bb97c5145343b5078c02d465f5 the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are nt as easy as the ipod s  or as  sexy  looking
b48feb7e6209e47420ac1cab656ae710 the software is quick  easy to use  i found the entire process very easily mastered
a88ee172e70d1886ca28bcf0b5ba1d06 as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away
aeaf53d9981fcdae134d914c14c3bf3a overall it is a great unit  hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it
3d98a205976ec0e232aa4bcf14021d0b this did nt bother me too much because it s still a decent size
b24bda91f521ad2ca3847636eaba7568 it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly
16ac12ea22acb0865fbe839e4b386158 the front cover  which you remove to take out the battery  feels flimsy but when snapped on  the device still feels pretty solid
9875f6fe729cc22fabf62ec61986b351 great price
6d07f4207f4fb66fa8b28f912a9de794 i thought the software was decent enough  it was nt complicated to learn at all
7c980ce6e3db331419916b5538ddd428 the scroll button is sort of annoying to push  a nice button would be nicer but eh  not a big deal
ecc2a0ecdcd48e0d7d52b66af830f9f0 i would have liked to have given it 4 12 stars docking that 12 star only for the size
21ebed2a97f528417ad5da338ef26ef7 now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things  the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect  fast as hell in music transfer  controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button  great sound and ive heard many mp3 players  a ton of different equilizer type deals on here
033b35286cae2ac0ec2fc080f51e500c there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious  a little larger than other mp3s but still light  the software takes some time to get used to  maybe 1015 mins   and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall
cc2a5126d27ea1de2649523d3ac82c6a but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything
8121831049060e4e814eb90a284743c5 ive seen em all  the archos  dell  ipods  everything  good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion
00b26e308a4b8730247f6846646d008a its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does nt sinc with contact lists  phone numbers  address books  ect like the ipod  which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device
7967db31bc77438a94a846ddeb630669 finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels  first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks  flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store  which  if you ever plan to pay for your music  is by far the best
15d9cf3e39596240efc9e3ba0c79e5a1 price and capacity
1410831d46d56db6a5d5e35d549b0839 slicklooking design and improved interface
acdaa29179a637e892dd726100d6557b removable battery
ad71306ca9a64f28e317dd789b8d22d2 protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window
55dab1cfdddd4a895855e44900c1da52 scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models
ca72c2fb4eef254b80c4d2051a89c457 eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files
e781c09e3c443732c8f53703efb0b736 does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones  or external receivers  car radio
3a0a5560d7bf0fbf314c2dd2947318db software is absolutely terrible
33f231b9745e1d5d1ef2a29379d0825d will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles  if you have live albums or greatest hits albums  this will cause you inordinate frustration
2c56bc9b793294d7e71cb2a6ca92bd76 does not recognize player at random times  despite being connected and displaying player s library
b2e9195b55b3d4ac0429cebac50af3a0 too difficult to change genre  album  track information for large number of tracks
97e094a508427d2e9e048c7e86aae737 you ll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best
3fd077cfdb53680671d6b273e8b56c20 a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be
ea2c514a36f45b31b1c75ee1b8e84f0b file transfers are fast  nearly a song per second via usb 20
9a0d7726564146fb03c68fd115bed324 my one issue with the mediasource software is that  despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service  the ripping process fails to populate the  year  field
ee31d7df41f71e9ae037cdf06e1512c9 to my ears  a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd  and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player
1815e3af4f811c08b874fb48013a9edc the eax features are pretty cool  as well  as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that  for example  compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train
4571ab0de8e8a459a17e954063b78c9d navigation could be better  but there is nt really anything the zen xtra can t do once you ve gotten comfortable with it
d8737e5e75f38be5112109d102d4da02 at the end of the day  what i wanted was a largecapacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go  and the zen xtra s combination of price  capacity and features easily meets those criteria
a14a922a3325a69475213f69d9c1a3e1 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks  and the ease of use is wonderful
8eb5d2fca4a827e8e326a4df00c9b809 the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs  my entire collection of cd s will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun
23437ff0a6808a5975343315b39f966d plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad
e36d6c54ed710942569ac8dc47ef1c8b the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the hohum software that comes with the system  and the traveling case it comes with
2505b3eb37eb261c8202ec3d03ef5c52 ripping the songs  even with my 11 usb connection is still very quick  and the quality is very good
4eb5f2954876bf5f8cf65bf5ee5d832b considering the price and specs  this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player
f53180de30a7308dfce4f7c6df47edae first  the battery is replacable by the user  because creative intended it to be  unlike apple with the ipod
700f48300fa8def127637b87e04b7e68 it was easy enough to remove the front plate  and there was only one way the battery could be inserted
241e92f11d46769e40d74aa4b77795f6 the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could nt be easier to use
4e2e70820a49ac08fe4e3c87254942cf you can create playlists  drag  drop songs and playlists to your player  and rip directly from cd to your player
39cd7109f8321f41f52bb1e4faa244b6 and with usb 20  transferring music to your player is incredibly easy
68dfe1e6439e1d2fafdd1dcf2ce1d498 the sound is great  and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise
632c86be964171dbcc6fda361e4135dc i thought i d have to buy a set of headphones to use with it  but the included earbuds work quite well
6aed866da58eea721927bebb9ef3ee6e i ve played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too
f99faf2dfc3e8af6f1f6221e99b19533 however  i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off
dea30bd0a5bde7f25c08bb9e1ae9417a also  the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display  so even though the side controls are reachable  i have to open it up to see the display
e17e18380718fc3b0a9d1deacbd92ff8 this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of  and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues
f6f88d89f1bb907351dcee2f580dfcba the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks  when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation  a slightly audible click  if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do nt even notice the click
14d20e2bcf29b6bcafa9483b929a2de6 1 creative mediasource software is ok to rip  catalog  burn music if you are starting from scratch  but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen  278 cds  3400 tracks  125 gb of music all ripped at 128bps  and guess what
159b67abc278328bcccc6d17c611028f mediasource did not recognize my tags
c08ea81dfd0032ff6d47afa0112ba4c1 2  despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality  i experienced a flaw using eax
d6255391e01cbaa0b68fdb9cf3e4e183 creative are  the  sound people for computers  i can t understand why eax would introduce static
b45fbddd121d5a06ac46d216611c9b71 3  mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws
8c911f0be96ba4560218d1f4847f02a8 in other words  the zen is not a convenient data storage device  only buy the capacity you need for your music collection  see point 1 for some sizing information
7ab7a3fdf39cb28801ac1dcd470adf13 but this is  not documented  in the zen manual  neither the hard copy nor the cd version
48c0b3b084cbc34f0220be2c1e263f02 7  mediasource did not install on my personal notebook
f17720aeafd313670cd2350bf2e39041 m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp  but not creative  without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists   it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your music  creative or any other company  all my 125 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags  hooray
2f4b1a4eefb0c421b14cc034af6fd056 given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software
76697d1f74e7bf972afa33e74ab84613 it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device
5713f609f1c720f88066bbaa337daca1 the pcside software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it s not as bad as some reviewers have indicated
496c1896b2e7b5f68f4a805a4611b9f8 one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software
f6d65be6923c9fe3a8774db12bb405c2 they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the samesounding name  and they are long
86231998768f09496e0db50c3fc87fcb screen was good  easy to read
11cad0fb95b4ff543a79a44d44e25e37 the software that came with it was tough to load
6e9251e0ce409a341fcc88059061ef02 the top did not fit well into the unit   felt defective
7a7cd8ed6ebdbc8c995a2dea76a50865 the cover that came with it did nt fit very well
263d0a57e0a6df089c6e71aa7c3d8439 the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was nt in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage
15c31085c6c71aeacffc1df322ba7655 the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality
8df2f7ba58c455f15ea3d272c2556f50 navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer  and vice versa  was easy too
602351ae5883dd3c1b0573f9071110ed many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it s easy to use and effective
eab68e8ffd01e853dd876878b35cd2ad i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision
702438ed98f2b97a5f63641e00164027 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen  the front panel refused to clip in correctly  leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player
20d3a45cf59c04e869a7f7ce2fd28dcf i m not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for
e69e578d052893330d9d3661ae730ceb the price  performance looked just right
cef7009c693118f1f13f7521c361b2de i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because  as other reviewers have pointed out  the construction is pretty flimsy
09d97450c691cb0d4d37880b6dfbc0f5 like other reviewers  installation was hell
df460eaf582c2debf712f5605d908023 my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be  at best  a 40gb portable hard drive  albeit one on which i can t create folders  or  at worst  a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again  i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating
8854150f66545a6724f8fddff2cfd170 i purchased a jukebox  it got fried while being recharged  they asked for  20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing
3bf21a4b29d090cbd158c4195701fcd2 1  great sound   98db signaltonoise ratio beats ipod s  unspecified  ratio  and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large headphones as well as external speakers
ea750d90f9785597047a0e1fba8c7a2e with my sennheiser 497 headphones  the volume is loud enough at 12  max is 20
49c99b34744d9c137422c89b385c5e8b the player works well with my sony srsa 202 powered speakers
dd00a38d580f6f271c19d5bf9766fffb 2  the player user interface  ui  is intuitive to use  and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection
4147498480996841498df2bb40d27af6 5  the cheap  userreplaceable battery   50 from creative  is a great advantage over the ipod s battery which costs  100 to replace
2372fb6a2b84de05a3b0daa7c5597402 7  chic look and good build  the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate
6bc32f701b31d3e1398b32992b827143 8  creative mediasource  although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer  is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service  gracenotes
e9d28867f6cc8362413781bc3fa7002f c i do love audio sync which allows a oneclick synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer
2e3f4a9da60918bdc961149cf8e14d7f 11  minimal pause between songs  less than that on other devices  good achievement for a harddrive based player
8d1f6697eefabe40a2bed7c33818a32d 12  big storage  my entire cd collection in one small device  5717 songs  491 albums and counting
cc3ee72e0899d1c615746015fea311ec 2  music organization is based on id3  by genre  artist  album  etc  and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information
be0e0a7720ad5ee47b7615913913b9f3 3  folders cannot be created for the audio files
201737d869c21044e5ddeaabacc4115b 4  no fm or voice recording  these would have been nice extras
8448fda5701874e7c112eea37250d87a 5  lack of good accessories  this is more of an oversight of creative s marketing
967a8d9bc57c82103bdca1471b12db56 6  the case occludes the display screen when it is closed
00562a00a0ab2c377658f1ccf279b3bb great sound  good interface  replaceable  powerful battery  good software  wakeup  sleep timers  multiple play modes
3bf7f4167edc15ec9e41d1fe2b1a2e31 not plug  play  relies on id3  no fm or recording
4a8114950fa4f98cb3de53513afcef87 i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i m not too keen on wwwipodsdirtysecretcom
682aa49b80fe174f1cddcc32da547cb6 replacement battery is  50 compared to ipod s  150
c59926d4de7d0d8aab8db084c3141f7d the only thing i do nt like about this is the cover does suck
67bd9ef657ec9fe0e24675e255e6ee0d headphones suck  i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature
d1c69646c5abb52ea97b186a5217b56a the software sucks
5bb67d6b0f270f6dd88cfaec1fa5ce90 also the feature to automatically put in the song information is nt always accurate
963946499f774ec9332f0bc2849487ec kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward  but i can deal with that
c3343c3835f3c03085268bc260ac595b software definitely sucks  hangs up my notebook about half the time  but i do nt mind buying notmad
bc08e98f66ff8b5d49eb77ff1cb0452f i am annoyed that the player s not automatically recognized as a hard drive
3c142f3ad2ba81850af376a8769ae736 i loved it until it broke  but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work
fba2cf23926fa2aa67d2e28a09f712df i loved this product when i first got it  great sound  easy to use  even though i agree that the software was nt the best  and held enough songs to suit any mood
5edd2e3912aadfe55b64bee98b5416f2 i was willing to live with the larger size  inconvenient on the road  but the durability was a big zero
13ed9f0eb7cfb3f0871a1f60badfc088 the combination of the price  storage size  and player features makes this player the best on the market
d60207defc4aa4824d6b29dc1c371a00 fact is  it could nt be easier to use
f92d4e355a7e7406d4cef21d9018f276 the menu allows you to search for files by artist  genre  and album quite easily
a0fdee29f22fcfa33ef66cdb8b74405c the battery stays charged for a long time  and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter
555cdaa018e5b651305e027afa46e533 connect the player to your computer  via usb   open up mediasource  and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra
d406da7c7294dc2ae57fc241ee00371d minor complaints  1  even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player  the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable
dbc1a57bff1911a3cd8ebade561c88e1 the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player  but not the folder name
9fab3fa1513794381fb4939e464dcc56 first  the sound quality is okay  but  as at least one other reviewer has mentioned  the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes
1aadcbc62f9835b3cf41665c5eceb72c second  the menu system and controls are poorly designed
db9a65f361d82bc676d6a2101487ca56 the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well
4d48c9058303e08948d73947903087dd the general button placement is not very user friendly
0274c135b199dbc2203f17aa3978816d third  the poor design continues with the case
a885b5a985f79263561e8a12ab307a35 overall  a good buy for the price
3ecab0f0f7b012bc1f10a6dda17f52bd easy enough to navigate through  although i d prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll  pushbutton
5ff308be46611d62288a5557efa3016e there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours
7c34e517718ef2880221cd7408e54f54 the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case
3bc4feba5ac935dba2cf5229f7485723 at the very least  a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice
05b005a587509a9b418bc7b414f03e1b pros  huge storage capacity for the price  easy to navigate  can modify existing playlists on the fly  has a removable battery
6e60d87ee941a545e7c31d2faccc3964 battery life is about 14 of that advertised  no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players  on or offline   occasional software lockups  replacement battery is expensive
ea590102fe54b3305e3c92c7f680c4d9 creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality  poor product support  difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack
6749d9e57b3b07fe4aa63fb5d4051e1a what is added in functionality  battery replacement  detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off
9962a0395a42bef512fbadba4dcc1ee1 feedback on creative s product support is universally poor  this is not limited to the zen  it applies to all the company s products
5665cc636f7aeff4e22e1cacfc8c571f the creative software is awkward  difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers
595586dcd393895e2ca8c8a038c133b3 the zen does nt support folders so it is not really a storage device  even with third party software that  creates  folders  documents and programs can t be launched from the zen  so it is not a hard disk  it s a storage device at best
673dd22fb3775b937ed0c3edfc1eeeaa but with a low price  comes lower quality
6bcac49498fd30b88131b83404d6bfaf our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality  great features  long battery life  and an unbeatable price
73480e313222d36d17f0d77e2ea9d735 i bought the player this week and i like it by far
66a0c26d06a2de11f1e77c0df92b5a63 removable and cheap battery  a li battery usually works properly for 13 years
7e81a078a85a4e02906c1bfdb55cba34 value  comparing data storage with price
13ff3f475a1d190111027f926eb4750a the appearance is okayed  at least not ugly
a54036bc903c3a1cd6a4d867969199de the size is small  just a little bit bigger than an ipod
6fdc93d1d1fb8b64ab5bb713a74acb9f easy to use  a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
1a3ae89d0d2443ff2dec1d8b3772dc43 the software  mediasource  cannot work on my pc   laptop  intel p420  xp os
f36365781e2d87d761d5f6c5b23a90ab in fact  each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place
53300d7a7dd55e15a9b1ca34d833f210 in short  this player is good at size  value  hardware design but really bad at its software
ad033c1a3f9aede7296c967e3125b16f the display is awesome  you can see everything you want and read it clearly
39e04a3877da6e2dd43afd9b1587c5f3 huge storage space  i loaded my entire collection of music  which isnt that much  400 songs  and still have 26 gb  out of the 28 provided to you
148b1ce6d32ce2ca6d79482fee329435 the sound is awesome  but if u put it too loud  depends on yoursound quality  the sound might crack
a35aae065a501637e0500caa8560e498 with eax on  you can modify your sound  with 4 different presets  which is pretty good  you can get different variations with it
11ea6cc51cd764b97b163d2625b56407 if you use software correctly  put in all the id3 tags  you will get an awesome database collection  from which you can easily access your songs
2c18484d512b4fc04c7dbcce1d30f543 i dont know what other people are saying  but the software is awesome
df802df13330b60399ef8b6c4a7f1791 battery recharge  is an awesome thing  because it recharges in only like 23 hours
7e63cb8c38074e8e588f45686c470b8e when you turn on your player  the player turns on really fast  and the music continues to play  as you left it when you were turning it off
76e1f9c946b4e5b0f0c7e5da55e53d60 you can manage your profile  change the contrast of backlight  make different type of display  either list or tabbed
4e222be5574201bad2e38c874688344f you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of  now playing  interface  you can see the interface as modern or classical
70e416274d57af61bd643350514fbeb5 there is an alarm  i still havent used it yet  but it should be good
18ad6637472a97bc27c037d097d32a99 there is a clock  and date  which can get helpful
ce888bac166e88a3566b17a71d3ec5bc the player has firmware  which will remove the glitches  if there are any
c70fb67c5efeb4037aa2b2f54e618a66 the music plays awesome  never skips  even if u run for a bit  so you can listen to music without interruption
648fbc07d2a2a8cf747e25741707426f the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said
dd21167cb92bce0551aa2a38dcec88fc you need the software to actually transfer files
50db0cf84edf2ce76e2152697582c0d0 the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on  60 percent of the time  it sais  shutting down  which means i have to turn off  and turn it on again  which is not to my likings
12a9609d2f9ab5d594c30af46279fe20 and also  it s priced very affordably
bbaf3f10e9f4fa129011180196717cd9 with 40gb of storage i have about 7500 songs on the player  everything music file i have is on there  with room for about 2500 more
eb88968921d7cb163079768a48fd733a the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair s  notmad  software because of some advanced features i wanted
0908662baf8f85d175cd9e342db17d3e the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds  but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones
fe401e4c7ad5871abaee9660a3bbdd76 possibly the biggest advantage this player has  if price was nt enough  is the fact that the user can replace the battery him  herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery
60f14cbc1a1f1fba8df34fb32d3b3aa8 since batteries do run out on everything  this will also be a big moneysaver since ipods  irivers  rca  dell  all have builtin batteries that need to be replaced by a technician  apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement
78c51d9eb31454b8f9dba754a0353b4b try before you buy if at all possible  although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod  the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface
4c76049a09d1439c8cbb4195acbe94c2 i like the nomad s color better  but it s not terribly flashy
c878d78d4400ab65e3a924840f7fd73d price
5eb85ac763d22bf04c5e505636188e0f sound quality is wonderful  i really like the smart volume sound normalization
892483abe8f893aed943d349d2886f49 yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway
652850fadd74debed2ce46db645d02fc i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song  playlist etc fast enough
8c88f5804b903ab5b9cc7f24942c353f i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer
20f4caa1b3acf788d80ee49ac27d76cd creative software stinks
b1ea002e94262c6b402e3f320e945036 the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did nt notice after first day
3013b20a1a3e81cbad3c0c9d9769afe6 have had the player since xmass and love it
92198989402e17a45ecbf5ef78c65e91 great sound  very long battery life  i routinely play it for 12  hours   very fast recharges rate  removable battery  storage size  nice screen  firmware updates  and great price
bc8cb26f2e111e60b22ac940195a192f short warranty  3 months  so i got the extended warranty at best buy   occasional freeze up  easily fixed by popping out battery   somewhat flimsy navigation wheel
a94aaabf3cef30309f2f69f92777dcf8 this is an excellent player  especially for the price  with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod
b9bfe35c56e22b2e41d54ff0d9f5e938 for a price that s still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster  and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some
cc9343b9437cedbe76ed6e65ab813167 the system is terrific in size and design  imo looking better than the ipods
c89290e4f08ad015ca64345fd0491bda it s very solidly built  and has a nice dense feel to it
d8012015c19cafbf96cbc6cad5741bba i find all of the controls wellplaced and not flimsy in the least
549c7d7059064e5d04e7311335d378a8 the screen s large and easily read
a41a3006363fa471b7f43d1b0173295a sound  exceptional  though i can t really compare it to the ipod
6c587ec84e8bea740d33edef4d6d427f interface  practically seamless
0a00b74b0ff92b29a1f105bc7d87ff27 playlists can be generated on the fly  which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus  or by using the software  and there are a bevy of eq options
bf0a5e500cc50d952088360876e9fd68 the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance
c5fb91677140916fcce268347c2b912b as i mentioned before  the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said  though notmad may still work better
a1feb88ffe4cdeae946e399e8757f7d4 it was no problem for me to use their software
b7a4b4086ff6f9e114fd0bbca4c9e6cc overall  i m giving this 5 stars as i ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over  but as i ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack  hissing  or scroll wheel problems show up with me too
ca88fee0f48f7e3af6abbce6bb924179 please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod
cfe17418da865149723d4f155249429c do nt buy this player
997ab59cbaef0807070bff4764f6475b unfortunately  after loading 280  songs  all i get now is  player either not connected or busy
cfe17418da865149723d4f155249429c do nt buy this player
0656a30c9ed3fb142df1a73db0d22f6e do not buy this product
181a7b7896f3a5bc487caf123b3e4a42 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended
e31dd62f55c1c30d4c665bd6ad5606e1 the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products  which is very dumb
b3362674852ddec1cdf253a98147090e honestly  i love this player
25da27d72af155af06e6c5874f503ef7 once again  the sound is awesome  the batterly life is only 68 hours  and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life
63b191a3a9ad3bc38caa73ddb3d65fb1 because other people that complain about this player are talking bull  this player is awesome  it just breaks fast  which is horrible
915a3cd71076181978eeddd26e184a3e every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes
ccccff139fff46b68ee5e5d3b5f6720d the controls are somewhat harder to use  and there are some oddities about the software tagging system  but most people can live with this
0640603a2170d71444627f4f433fd0bd there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone  it is a great phone  mine worked without any problems right out of the box
1e497d003ead8f158733c4abb51c307b my favorite features  although there are many  are the speaker phone  the radio and the infrared
ef6ad218bc4eef8f153f8382e40b1d89 the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of reentering my numbers
d91e2e3ad9ceb824579f6c9037ef53c0 the day finally arrived when i was sure i d leave sprint
b2f4d720af4b3e13021ec32d815a83e9 here s the brief synopsis  the phone is tiny  cute  feels kind of  plasticlike   as if it might break   but seems pretty sturdy
60918d91db20f0758f77fc85122e79da it has lots of little cute features  my favorite being the games and the pim  personal information manager  ie organizer   and the radio
272a58a1b62523e335da2584a82415e0 i spent hours setting up the stations  accepts about 1314  i believe   though the reception is unpredictable
e8e469c6ce127a2b8e862966b0c3685e the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine
cb73b87bc53d6be47ba62c64c5eefff1 the phone comes with okay ringtones  some decent backgrounds  screensavers  but the phone has very little memory  mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon  so you do nt have too many options on what you can put on there
176c335143b62d493291b9381376198f the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i d have liked them to be
0e06083fe29cb04b2490c7bed0b91061 the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly  dangerous when you re driving at night   and there s no way to change this
0fd1a39fbd9bf7572e59b5af4057aeba the buttons on the phone are small  even for my small fingertips  but you get used to them rather quickly
7b0c7e612d4594b5feb8cc2e0327afd4 the volume
b1faecc5dd56946295f5940b7205af66 i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet
d59318453bccd6b57857e2fa7b73f426 i do like this phone overall  would give it a 35   but unforutnately  i am returning it
0f6c7d35d2490b7ca16cdcb8408f2fd6 also  their tzones  although cheap   499  mo  never works
b5327e3ee32cce3ce1ba792f2b91d0a3 i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks  when tzones never worked
eb5960db45bea27cec164d0be627fcf5 apparently  tmobile is heavily backlogged and can t keep up with demands
1f9933726e41699013c87cc15f21a066 tmobile is trying very hard  and again  they do have pretty good csr s
0bd4b7ea23395053267cfdb384e926bd however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince megastatic  to the point where i d have to dial numbers 67 times to get a clear line
464ae5e381f94d45fed8ae02ad5e7495 i m staying with sprint  and though i fear that their csr is nt nearly as good as tmobile s  the clarity of their reception is exceptional
ed192d62003130c4d569a0a4a5335f00 i highly recommend a nokia 6610
5951baa50c5670e7c4fcac86438fba32 no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers
e52d5fd102dc709b3e64330ff8edc1b0 from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity  to the downloadable polygraphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone
df13323ca2d2bad277b722c7c99e24f0 whether you re taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you ll be glad you had the fm radio
a65e5a99fb034d3ac3e57d4f41070f43 i treat the battery well and it has lasted
3c8ffb554f238698530ef85279f9b51f the volume level of the phone is not all that good
8b15359b7863064bb6750c1a814f9531 some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear  but not easy to listen to
147682229af074d2520a07e45499562b the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times
542ecb92087418bd79ca9e3c8a527ca6 the vibration is not top
0a672f3d94178693fef4a061788aba10 overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned
d0d621d83a44b4ab35ea2f818978ec04 great battery life  perfect size  but a tid bit quieter than i would like
281040b8774d702e6c0e6bc76b39cd49 radio is awsome  but it does nt work unless you have the earpice in
bad709d57055304005f6f24f865dccd3 tmobile was a pretty good server
907a71d6c58acc8a9c22afee0469cda1 this is a very nice phone  but there is no warranty on it
624560fdbd238195725255ae991483d2 we got two phones for the tmobile family plan  indeed very easy to switch to the family plan  and one came with a broken headphone  can hear but cannot be heard  and one died today after less than two weeks of use
18ee059bf53dd5ae2d4886fe25c789e5 when i got it home  i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were nt there
867e0d28796d18caa886b83e1e446570 while i had the phone  the positive features were  good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece
23f161907c6d5ce5f76a95f06dcb4341 negative  impossibly tiny and difficult to operate  barely visible  power button
aa4cf9874eb6024ec9e908b53f471f6e poor visibility on the keys
64fb66cc374fec3973bcd3984f004f56 the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make
0f3ebda9dd649fa1b9ee293df38ce088 only con i can think of is no camera
b18d97c31148dff6d6db14b6cfccefff this phone is a winner
f9c4741602222f5858fdfd5117f96f7f anything this phone does  it does perfectly
77b556e279c1f849536cf447d15792cc the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly
744203c0ba661b81fbf49e058d3b8553 this phone has a very cool and useful feature  the speakerphone
2180e3aa72c77087063e51f98d1dafb1 you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does nt make that big of a disturbance
89d1608e6db7e19a13aaf864a061353a only one complaint about the speakerphone  you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone  not while it is ringing
8920ebaa803b842f68dc03f411e539ae this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in
c9d0d998766ff632aa6c28c85f4926f0 this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio  but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone s radio should work perfectly
9bd2f43850ccfea3e4b6a5ef927c98c6 i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly
d379b42593ec45fb92354860d5f031da the only problem i had was a small glitch with tmobile
a892ae4eda5b2b52e80f56aebc1e502c anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception
75724e991eee9149c45dd759aeb7f1fd another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone  the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world
44319df7de849e736c4e09bf62fef41e this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones
86fbc0120dc9e7b25d672355dc9d3046 when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there  it is unbelievably small and oh  so light
21250d9726c5df5ab8b704a872ef5d69 this is a benefit for many reasons  one being just for appearance  your pants wo nt be bulging with this phone in your pocket
c2a7637809be14daf7c7003015c6dcbc i ve used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar
068bd7c0f0afc39243b4899bb1fe99a4 it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light
8b06ee9536157bdc30f89af9097efd4e this phone has many other features  ir   just to name one  the features above i view as the most beneficial
c67d6bcd1ecc6effe34a9f8354eddaa0 the phone has a few minor inconveniences  but only because it lacks those features  bluetooth and high spend internet  but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do
17f6d670f0087e4bd79ea3d9763fd40b overall  i highly recommend this phone
947e4a7f76574c8d9e61e6f0a4bf403d it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package
fe5fec6558b2e30fcb5d27fdc47570d2 size  extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you
d36bdc5dfa57c2ffcd3b26042b66d2e6 sound  excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice  check cons  it also doubles as a radio  which is a nice feature when you are bored
c63b814a0a679b601fcf858056f31723 speakerphone  loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch
5741b29bc5d1f08561ddf80eaccd827d surfing the web on it is nice as well  i just wish there were more wap pages available
712b40736863d9fcec15b1a1a63e4df4 the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out
c16c5d2303fcab3823fe913b6b4cef82 games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games
105924e46523168dd9a09a96a05d6a46 nice little phone  light compact
ceb0982ee639d31ed4e5f43a46e69336 buttons do seem a little sticky tho  and the hands free kits  connector might be a problem
c08ffc6c0204ff4421d6802f9f85c134 the reception and sound quality are topnotch
8b4057f457380127479d55edc7268abf i like the size and weight of this little critter
8c8bbd4a1f9a38c0933fcbd3803b117e the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it s not too weird
88b9aa2d53178b2ce98e7c56d5c5e0d8 the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the    key instead
eeeacba322957f4c880a66e6ed2a23f0 the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors
b7fe89c7512fb83bb17ebeaa6b53d631 it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones
ca660c79507a52586bd84954fbe54df2 but  then again  the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office  when i was already out on the street
ee4f9ea014db0467f570da311f7dd2ef light  compact design
279afba7eb3af9e233fc1951d252d6e6 solid  highquality construction

79fdc99cd2e5ba077ab8625e5ec1d969 no option for callerid pictures or individualized ringtones
f3bb75d4d6b62c19c453c3d7a0d1fcd5 one of the best cell phones i have ever used todate

2fcb297b562e0085ac2b38a1e5132982 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited
e1f513486ead63210b2558f6ce800427 while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones
d6508cf7de570cf330c9dbd17b8d3f48 and really this is the best phone one could have
335bcc6ce494a124577345aecffc9989 it has all the features one would need in a cellphone
59a2ec1ac86933ead0b9c58aa109d6bc it is lightweight  sleek and attractive
8a2a59c57f95dc9e5061930baa5d1265 this phone is very userfriendly  easy to manipulate 38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc
326cf16219eae8f13c9dd3f7095d8206 it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime
4e5aa4d9868bfcce9df64306ddf57b0c its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently  lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillowside
285382587275bb6699276d5b9ea9c3ab it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes
25663e0511f1372b1b8380dbf18b7a2c only if we could get one camera in it
d716a674425cad5f35cef12e2494768e i am enjoying my phone a lot
89e17bc3dd3643eef452c0b526b1397b small size
baf721ae66c83d04627aed9efcbf7aab it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar
6e389542d89508957c8af12f28f181a9 the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing
1dc3740e06e3a4b6aef93300ba191638 navigating through the menus is super easy  especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone
df4b2757c7fb3ddb025743cbe93973c1 the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless
bc2579b51229368645d63774f91960e1 it also has a stock tracking app built in  also useless  and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics  currency  length  area  etc
643ae680e1c446a56269220fc32e4129 regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop
47e3873452377bfeaeb451bfad9ba553 overall this is a slightly better than average phone
793b5dd3a570afa3f48e4ec4ed2e097c this is the best phone i have seen
804b696067270d8a0d3985843a4c90a4 the phones are awesome
8709abbebe927492ab2305fce12bac51 we hardly ever have to charge them  get great reception  live in chicago   and the customization and applications are awesome
3cfd003cfecd282858702db176f2d30e i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it
431de366bef375532c8858467cdb6096 nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games  graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom
cd886273a55bc57a2201d12617b65f4b i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had
307c93e8a0e6940c41d5d78c4dba4954 the features are really cool like the radio
b89efe0de0fd797ce86e413b78bcc046 the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it
f7ad72dd81513ff8fba2a51a2ac0bd2f technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great     i love this phone
fcf866589e0cd5066cdb86f7e386fe2e i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features  but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone
5e621b8f3d3b01939c7ca7308eec4cd4 for a specific location  i still think its a great phone
58e7e474b8ea3dcf3293853aae627fc1 this really is a great little phone  its got nice features  a beatiful screen  great ergonomics  and its tiny
e680c8f77215069e5769f8ec644a5cee this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size  it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out
6fe554bb692034563c238b99119b81ec nokia was my first nonflip phone  and i m glad i decided to go with them
8ee54a07a100d3ae716ff48a9b13ef2a the phone is small  light  and very attractive
66c96d417bca7af0fbf9a1d25d7bf577 the color screen is a plus  as are the polyphonic ringtones
e15b74942a53b496fef02984e5eede92 i m not one who uses web browsing  so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs
00f4f2006de708c2e8e1b5f70f053974 i do here a constant highpitched distorted sound  not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough
bbdd399a8aa07bc878d531a293918676 it is a great phone  if you are traveling all over the world  packed with wonderful features
cd4327cb2d23f487b5853995261ec659 the handsfree speakerphone is quite powerful  like the motorola phone  i used to own
9d0740971a20ab06bf942f4cdc6c18bf in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset
e1bef08bc65ba3487923aec367168f32 the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport
7d7d4d07552660b8043027100c94a48d additionally  it has more fun stuff like more tones  wallpapers  screensaver  stop clock  alarm  java applications  chess  currency converter etc
7c8f3f41daa8a96742203572b5b47386 the mobile text messaging  chat  picture sharing etc other nicities  that you would enjoy
56432fb57d72bb6e3c00b29f7a0cac93 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone  which you will enjoy
79912796c4d723c8ef835ad78c993024 i can recommend this phone to anyone  anytime
13e3ad521538757c809d312f2b720148 not only is it the perfect size  not too small  not too large   it also has all the features a hightech phone user would want
238d0351c8c8c466d81f67763e3871b1 in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned
7f5b26b2865cc958e9fec839306cd9cf the phone book is very userfriendly and the speakerphone is excellent
014aa078aecf0b50593f6613db26ebbc even better  with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio
7aba4051c00fd6801f9538e897377aed the keypad is a decent size  but the power onoff key is small and difficult to press
28fd6ff95028de4d9ea392d1a09a45ff overall this is the best phone i have ever owned
bb033600536809f287cbf986f6529298 one complaint  the screen is too easily scratched
bc412b771cb33944aaf00912480e5a71 it has great battery life  fm radio  excellent signal  hands free speakerphone  which i have to say is probably my favorite function  and downloadable java apps
abd74cd1dba7bfb5fe0802beda2c54f5 great phone
e34cfc5c5d47ea85592063b8cfa07c03 great features
2ba94a2d6897c0dc29eaf3f1c90562af i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email
5560c8233e34185b814bf994e5893c76 i have had no problems with the phone
8d147490bc04d64017ad35bd9084f37f great phone  i d buy another
b8c4180a9c3121e6ea19a6b4eeabba04 excellent phone  the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures
962d0a03e1daebad970b1586234fc351 overall an excellent phone
d1de0c348ee15ec5bcf5d444ff8a78d8 the service from tmobile is very good too
bda6c10fbfa269bc9c256d0a04ea7069 great phone  easy to use  excellent network  no regrets
c0c6d11001c00e04512caa20fe3cae80 i purchased this phone for just 50  and there is no end to what i can do with it
51b1770d89037fd1f2b3010444b9217d nokia and tmobile really teamed up well on this baby
9b759b22613ccb3d5a5909c5cd771409 service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from tmobile and aim is great
311ef14e9030cb4c54bc34ae0487a489 this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range  or like me  do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones
d3039095351362825c0bb445adb849f3 1 month  no problems  great phone i m very pleased with my 6610 phone
f5f02fd53530db47224dc07fa8d49e9b yes  the features are numerous
806cb5e252d42d9b0c9beb400622a8e9 the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i ve ever had
70ebd096a62bc6c6597664e0ebee99a7 the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use
93bdb754833d306450a122ff2ee879e5 i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ve used before
f5cbb3d03ebbfc0942b32ad9a8187168 the radio feature has superb sound quality
7589c75efb2663f7280de993fe911740 it has a classic design yet looks hip
17cc6d4ecf34b6e4ca099958ffdf2dbf the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there
74ab0cc3f6e22fc34b2fa57efbcb6936 this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities
dc93b572e66d7cee8d1301ab1059f27f the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls  real estate broker software  very well at all
df3688691b10a0e73dcdfb792b8e30b1 it does well in all aspects of internet browsing
ff02148f541cf5f18c7b9c51fb6d96d1 i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing
c580e8b16d0f0c69d6f4a6852f64e367 great screen and great sound
8f5fb743985c046f487e684660404026 the 6610 excels as a cell phone  thank god
5f632c925abff8ea973237469d07a2aa the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception  that is  in places where you get tmobile coverage  which is not that good  see below
5f86510c019b5a8471a682edff4d3332 the color screen makes this freeafterrebates phone shine bright  and commands are very responsive
0b54732d6bd649e17ed65361c1e1f178 my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons
42f9a3d24c13151b0c3eee5b5a85dd48 this model does have the traditional key arrangement  it s just that they are really close to one another  and have unconventional shapes  so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands
437957753d095bc51aec7470946afeac other than that  this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips
25c37ec2c74bd5e51f8e37c5a996c514 finally  i reiterate my thumbsdown rating for tmobile as a carrier
d6e2565e3aff0093275531850416b504 their network coverage is very sporadic  and the network always seems overloaded  resulting in very unpleasant calling experience
c942e7617c5617c46364266d80a29f69 the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is
743eeb5f1185f0007cd790563f3abfc4 after using it  i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket
f18154e30404fb3775505cae4d99fcb0 it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder  but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree earpiece which is included
2444c9bfc1b6cb142560eb1ebb714654 when i turned the phone on  the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is
f1215750c4fec903ffd2520c9d49c960 the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable
8ea22abcafee5d8784ac48d7824ecab7 the ringtones included are awesome  and did i mention they were polyphonic
3f4a8a9f30c37af03527a36fda76d179 you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call
dc8970a7ae3535e224c0efcde6cdc284 the phone also sports an image gallery  with option camera attachment   a calendar  organizer  alarm clock with snooze  fm radio  way cool  even if it is just through an earpeice   games  java applications and gprs highspeed internet connection
6678ea63baf21e42ca34ff9c60e47c7c the gprs connection is sometimes slow  and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain  but the other tzones applications are quite useful
b3f9fc452f442086e1d960c66db4a767 one downside  as of this writing  tmobile has nt updated their tzone system to fully support the 6610
73641eedb3d433bfe6a0c4832a6a2ded this phone is highly recommended otherwise
bab7c888a49b92e4221b1c4a319f20de nokia makes a great phone  that s clear
5e74b4c1331cab866091f6646439932c with all its complicated features  the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great
cb424d3ece8282ce9d98ff9e19d23c6c the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for tmobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have
4c97fb16f6c98310c527b30aa33a2434 the internet functions of the phone  wap and gprs  will only work through tmobile s services  because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network
2d9f1d8d7f3c3a79a868f38dccd16782 this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it
29ed127ae5b09fb6a770cea2c209ccf6 the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution
f814470075f9eaffe13f9b92b246daab it is very light weight and has a good signal strength
0e81cf9c89d6ccfb13d2f4e90af872de when talking the voice is not very clear
58d2a9f2d0c8ce55a5a4bf88152d25af but  i would definately recommend this phone
a05eeda6733206f3896d450dd927f8fe this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made
256c84e002437574427a138e66803e5f the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group
2d1c8c82d6c2d5c21ee6177fe26d4fe6 they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely   as all of my pictures have thusfar
4a44a69cb955602ceffa932a795dd6aa bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense  filters choices
656e72834c7ff8e049c4a59974414993 i d highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like
eae3fa8ec5597ddf6e714868e7a3068d this is my first digital camera  and what a  toy  it is
4f4ce92984a186b080eef02938290fa5 just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon s powershot series and its an slrlike camera  its 4 megapixel and  alsmost  full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance
8f2da3941bd227c6f14c4b153270cdd0 whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together
215563975507a7e8899c222ac12a65c5 main dial is not backlit
182dbace3a6e704ea16ab6aaf5ee6811 lens visible in optical viewfinder
fd67a8e85f570b024dd73bf89d57c402 in a word   awesome  is how i would describe this camera
0edeb8de7afc625a933b4c41f00abaf8 i wo nt go into the details here  as the online sites  stevesdigicams  dpreviews  go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers
cb09687e3f277e84ad47f09f17b2d882 i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3
8125b34510fad206a46ff327585af3a6 the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds
3dd55b27114ec5fd6815b8c30aa6e44f the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me
3d44c865026753694c91909c1268f652 despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography
f221ac367372a9d0142195a8c2d6879c i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful
ede478b04f16c8d0e4aec9e3f6e127d2 2  4mp is about right for the target market of this camera  semiserious amateur photographer
0e6be374d76b6035fc000c221a4e5d9c 3  4x zoom is nice
a61e41eb5761ad4e06fb2512a93a94e3 5  its focusing system is also very flexible
744bdb63eb27c487cfb368662c9dcc70 you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an onscreen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus
efe861ba1ba0ffd310e1e5335e5852a0 4  the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying
922bdfb560dc1c43d64652c25daaa354 the camera has a wonderful set of features
59eae132b2cb15aee8885c0e6c8856d1 the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures
41a7310667e145525710b6cac52c2c41 the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect
bd6e7dce4fc34417032ba104211c56a2 i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures  purple fringing  etc  so i am very pleased
2ba780a3839b97663494b0fa5de97d11 the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use
aa040e2aac44669936f89ea50c0ca0fe the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap  it is not very snug and can come off too easily  and the lens itself  it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd
66817f1a7ea8fb5f8cfe69f9bb6c0c2f the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use
92a84f4bcdb0e8397f661e972a956f52 it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price
9912ee61adbc16ba2940f26778c640d0 recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available
2cda4bc7420f9d9ce26921a41fbe9f75 advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable
7f28bc07721c2e384997b2808526e775 the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it s class
07b3bdbafaec9f6df8f50960a8c49f11 i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a firstclass digital camera at a reasonable price  there is no better camera out there  period
5e8d37c7fc800e394540cc47e42d3496 it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very userfriendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing
ae0aed0b3b73dea5b4506576ff783dcc this camera has canon s great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get
3053d1cbf4ec4303b5664147f3905050 the prints are beautiful
20213c2657b8735b886c7d729880f2ad although canon s batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want  more power   you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon
2234865f706759eb5217c759c1c4ca1e this is a great camera for you
3ecea01aa95a76d9bd9b4d7dc527100d the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use
dfd88ca0008f555cb2ee50c9bc7364bd i love having the option to manually control the fstop  shutter speed and even focus
c97426f7e6b7627ae5bb73ee0fe03b0b i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers
a132db45183ba2fa489bbbb91d064371 but if you ve used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive
be379679dac602b9b58a047cfe52bfb9 with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority  for high speed subjects   aperture priority  for focal length  or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality
333e87ce30ba03bd6f411b6b04304e07 this camera also has a great feel and weight to it
00d2f82e48aec8fa7159c18aacd4231e you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy
03ba56f0d39bdcc405e0e8c231587f54 this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it
449b83653dd0d66d7d910483ebd3238b but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it
60d51173b03f01faf9dbc703ee9747d8 just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has
7ced1ec672304d6828f66711815f1d0e takes excellent photos
3f56f9123b8ffd9edf96d25020e6c445 the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens
cb31f35d3c35ce640d8c859b871da89a overall it is the best camera on the market
4451b508ffcdcf474c6d4776729d055c i love this camera
16cd32323d48271d45afd13c1449f1f2 took hundreds of pictures and they were great
e4ef0ebc749295bdb2fcb874531a583e great colors  pictures and white balance
031b904a61e903f18f947e9c55fd4cfa i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust
491e7ad37f09de99ba745957bd2388c7 the grain was terrible
45a25aa300594454ca7bc12595df25f5 well flash photos are never great  and there was still a lot of noise
4af1a9d196ac9035aeb134474256ef16 when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were nt moving  the photos were awesome
7a86d5e0935a31a320bf4effa3643576 the camera was a marvel
5f746eb360f99eec03f4c5b8efb8f138 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images
7ce68523e9bd23cb9fa8f5c8bfadfa9f the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash
f1824e287ef5aafaf050e6870ece87c3 what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8
d189707ad42028eec72db14fec45c699 relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots
865f5ce19fc754d56e712de777b1bcae contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon
20c5a2780290c04a8fff006233aee834 now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7
c9e60af8c804cc7bc30a164554f7375d the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera
d94ba22ec1c68f129a09d111449a5e89 what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware
38c47be19193cb76675feafd049a684c without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image
511a23f3a4fe98af1bf9d231291e4dff the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software
d00579c5aee168118aee6243ff803b1c what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical
ca42696d0e457f98f2255b29dfa3f6dc but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera
f4d33ef7024c0c93baef74d60978635e this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well
4ee6d1359bfe9bbb24c18ef20aa068d0 not perfect  yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instancesbut the lcd works well enough in those instances   not the cheapest 40 mp  but the best 40 mp
d7f31e78e351ca72ab37f3787d581e2b the service from the supplier was exceptional
e02a562b016c98f5f4937af42dd41dba having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos
3797f31b7e658ca2289e807be4ce0066 by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced
1f8107d369d0a9aff676c54f789d4256 the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes
0c497fa3be9389b212b112840b0bb06e about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder
d5ff58c43fef03e404437a12b2520326 i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera
a2ab8a9ad0aa0c299ae01e2d3beafe89 but canon never fails to amaze
f33e57d6d1b0be40187d83879a82c9ea 3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing
b39d64cf16678723054310d16f83cb20 4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking
bbd842f2292be37cfe4f30cf8c94dd30 you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right
f774d50a8c6d2e482b4e764362bf0ccb overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view
80ccab7499b52c8d7a9bb1f85ab5e9d6 got way too many blurry pictures
ea03c1eca4f4843d18fa28fa8e577b5c 4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up
d0b638f07549767cb3b25c3f2d07ce93 the powershot g3 is a great camera
df9d18fa4b2ff7598d3524494f2cffb9 because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos
23e69255ff5527dfe5e34c9e371f9fde 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera
a820ec8ce849643a61378f3b7b7ef1ec it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features
65037ef283c79017feb83dc35b38876e the catch with the canon g3 camera   and perhaps all of digital cameras  is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots
d1ae657ded216525d98c55cabe90361b it feels slow to focus  and unbearably slow to shoot
b82837c0f2aa0002e428df001cedfcd8 unfortunately  this digital momentcapturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted
48bcb8b7a73b431d17faa7c86416eb2c this is my first digital camera and i could nt be happier
af189e49f9bda21796bc6e5b42d476bb with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots
c987fcf46ffc653deb0043f19e9b0e71 i love the eos based controls and easy menus
9f347041683eb18b50734c57bed47aaa 2  the body construction  buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic
299b1b3b82ed7f53d93796dd70e2715e it had a heavier and more sturdy casing
4e7c923125c6ecab9de7b6e8ee712cf3 this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it
b36e0aa3746cf7609c08e3323c9c46d4 am i ever glad that i decided on this camera
865ea00ba670fc3054260a8b5b0d9e2b i ve only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy
5deb915c0f8e40d34ff37101c900e021 very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera
51897af1e6e933645f228aa21c7f28d4 the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging
061d8f8a6d7c08ee50f8cc4d4e1b0344 the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom
dbec951619c24117174bfb3323091148 one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all
6fe1a6cfcc61bb420320d4d66e4e64c4 the best 4 megapixel4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use
fce426bd640deac130f446f53b1b80af because this camera is beautiful
f25f01faaec7c0eb164eab2e8c6d364e the g3 looks like a work of art
c12f2cbdc52ec5949ef5f7247c336b99 its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i ve seen
b974783e13b69f38d3a2b7aa1ac5eef1 you can see the lens barrel in the viewfinder
51691753f1446ed784e1e75e2da94ffb it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter
381cbba6fbf05b57f5065fbd5a751974 it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop
62231128d8faa8397072e0f77601ae9a i am quite happy with the camera
153d740584b0562e7e6b29315153d94c it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep
86b3450ce22023f2c9edfbb1431b515e best camera ever  from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything
bf6a7e1803fcb60ab4e76c2f4119489b first and foremost  it will take better pic s than most film camera s
71587775ee12268cfb110affaaf5b612 this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ll use all the time
1bf2d650dc6dd01868ac513222995eda however  for a  600   800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice
28625e5528127fc1474b0e6dad55a8cb it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing
3aa385cd2dfa03cfff8df46bd9cee92d also  the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage
921a0e8cd129e569ee56a67d7ae96da1 one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough
1bea3ea293d255cd27ba76a46ede23ef another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ve seen
5ac53d99601e0ac19ef6cc71435053f3 i have owned this camera for a short time and would nt give it up for anything
315c1b71c3150d8e7f65cc42175f4817 it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera
10a83c7e21b9720dc95f09ab9dd06707 it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly
e2aef133b34cdd27cfe0ae786a800c64 the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semipro  pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography
f2981378db18ffecc4c71766b545b0ed it is made of plastic
ef9668457ba8f4611b4fb06633bff330 the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot
263d74deb404b19e3971f7520d49ff06 the function lever  the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile
f11b6493f562e48e09dd1f455dcac0d3 flash  as with all builtin flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost
be780476104bcc4ce67b3dd09ac7ffbc the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to
573ec1f4c104f557d3ef4a81d7b846a1 the functionality on this camera is mindblowing
7f1c1b92e8f206c138f4db63d898414e canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out
1fce91bb44da1197a328766d1f0f3781 learning how to use it will not take very long
b43eea60a6e26ef2d546c1544c0e533f range of functions  as indicated above  it has something for everyone  point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography
5d3199c4c10ac5b497205480f52f828d this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used
4ee8d0b641c875e17446b74fd975c596 the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot
e4e579de7f6a6a60872e54f2bea20df1 this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 45 megapixel
17ea77f8baef8743561f50cf960f3ff5 in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great
6d9c0c4ae3a7b3f059e38dc675228984 the pictures are fabulous and their is a  short  learning curve to it  there are tons of features i have nt even gotten to
e446b8cb57e505d5021f433bc13a8ed1 the camera s a work of art  science  that s understood
5b3c35f2d0200b492eb1d84caff2bd26 it takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid
48c9089c4729e58f320f3da81288ee13 to address two previous somewhat negative reviews   1  yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder  however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder
67b82e06f82e9130f9d542e0ab393f06 this camera has a major design flaw
147a916c1effce3110d2582e4b8b49a5 when you look through the viewfinder  not the lcd  the bottom left corner of the picture  about 15   is blocked by the lens
c011703935a9bcb4fe2a8bf0e1e00a40 everything else about the camera is great
2acf539000dfb941b35ec78656c5b1b5 if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera
a7d8e305d570d95f2e66cc869353dc9a the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4times optical zooms gets you just that much closer
3bce35cc8493a2cd4c47a2a358643b7c the moveable lcd screen is great
a4bf04bb2ffffdf15f1e93ccd942ba31 the tiny  postagestamp sized  remote unit is wonderful  not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures
7168bc93960c3ccae9ad72cc71ab956b i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse
41d67c7360f1eaff9b82be88ea00f3d7 i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options  shutter priority  aperature priority  light metering adjustments  etc  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear
84224827af1c6fbe4ff62db111e2e0b4 i ve been bothered by blownout highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better
5a88ccedfd94e24afcf32afe34d0dad6 and the body  construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330
c24124e72afb21806504f88eb5809b93 i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there s no difference in working with the files
34400085cb3b7c1e079b9e19bd044b91 i ve now had the camera for two months and i m even more pleased with it
5d8b5507ce45f152c58e301e745b132e very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you re going to get at this price
682f66e2e701df8ae5c2394498111504 i ve been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it s advertised
ab5381ff92d93f31f37a3da98c2c14a6 allinall  i believe this is arguably the best nonslr digital camera on the market
ebe4e490a3d80b57d701bfa3b8e96ec7 canon s optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better
e30184599d5c95a24e9a14a132efb341 the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking  it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap  and it is a bit slow between shots
861626d0cc4cc5ae19684d4b8d53194c even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the best digital camera available under  1200
c014bc886849ad4649bc5b4f66967a90 definetely a great camera
1a2ff0b2fd0f3902bbc4db99f334bf30 proven canon built quality and lens
4073922627870a25467c904c1f869dfc feels solid in hand
2d02822aaf070b5602c867e2c6872e5d rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros
8de65221e06c8847ca5178ea15e60bb3 this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer
ab7ca5cbb8b25a52411977cdb137ac97 the pictures are razorsharp  even in macro
ad7d797df83b5741108707e4fcd267a0 the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain
56b6edc98c5db1d4c4d71a78b24a32e3 i enthusiastically recommend this camera
611cd84ef2797167021575937265cb17 it s easy to use  and yet very feature rich
85867662c99ae16df91919b54a6588a7 the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject
ab55f8223c7f8eb0cdf00f7b75379e04 i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power
9c725122d3b7c7c0a0c6becf2b40e44c this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do nt want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera
5c59913a2746f9f7b8bdc5d1d2d9d4b0 1  pictures wo nt transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable
d344448a7a486c45523610328a8804ee even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
d26b6ce9e6ae6bf633a32f98ba2130ac the movie clips taken will always have some  noise  in it  you can t avoid that
7c796cc382127a60c5fb968230a6441f but overall this is a good camera with a  really good  picture clarity  an exceptional closeup shooting capability
04644ae09ccdab517139e51d9b12fb84 i send my camera to nikon for servicing  took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem
858a58b51860cbf88e1296d8838558d1 it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality  but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service
d8aec8197d90051b1905ab04d212a10b made the camera totally inoperable
25cbfa15d29773c91313a905515b2078 audio on video also lacking
695d490cea19970e52fa3608c2ac96c8 otherwise  it takes very good pictures  shutter delay is nt so bad either
d0daccfd58ec29fbb2753db534018ca5 nikon 4300  i feel  is the best camera out there for the features and price
f54837594a492a2e5cd420e057d57eb4 the pictures are absolutely amazing  the camera captures the minutest of details
5c1f1d66d58cb4a5efe5515cfd7babe3 3  the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture
3649de2567f56d923eed19f3229fac58 the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem  battery charger  usb and video cable
9f043f0ebf4759c2f9e477ec5b0d50d5 i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers  and they both delivered great results
fc9c733c80eb0e7cc04d22457ba2ed86 even at the  normal  setting  a 8x10 print  shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels  you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital
113723c117c44d3f1da9fb6a41a2ac71 over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level
c2510219e55b231a7fcea212a897c722 focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time  pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange
bc5b775fbaf3738d15534b70ed290f17 after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures
4c6c28d1390c22b69d834cde174cecbc the inside pics  can be a bit challenging  but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like  that are not focused perfectly  or need lighting adjustments  make this camera very simple and effective
60439c997db437e7d90d94b08c0f8e09 i love all of the features  and presets as well
8014d78afa6f3ec55703089524168aea the software you get with this camera is perfect
50c321595603f8a73b80de24c33a2d9a touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct
94ede871dd61d7308d1e56b41b9b6165 all and all  i am extremely pleased with this camera
a037bc2334cf7856abb5cb99ee6cd3d8 great camera  great investment
1da9da21f6c3e925964f446dfeae9895 the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful  easy to use  high quality  and compact in size
0d9c98a0b96f462fb9a75d73a026a16e it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual
b0922801b5dea8dd234139e96c8e2937 the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too
8e15abfa6bd176e922dff2e1b273e3d8 downloads are a snap and quick
385f6554344ce3fdba684ad8bf694cd7 controls easy yo use and easy to get to

fa9bea2213c882ed1c6758c2c27a2af5 this is a wonderful camera
f11f55733c97916bcac103090871b473 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience  cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price
6ae2424de3771ebb00464135ccc4aa6f one neat thing  i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms  no problem for the camera  rooms looked like they had ample lighting
9f0a61055e1f449cb62f85d3d95c52bd this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon never knew i could love a digital camera so much
f911630310801ab1119c6a52bf2fa0da the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95  of all photos taken by a beginner
e9cea108831bf3b5f22307c5802bfb9e just point and shoot and the photos were great
b90042c61dd22f271426a9114ceb5795 if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one

ac4ab040f5068449f5d661c742ded24a this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has
1d21e72801ffebefdc107e08b9c2a77c i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots
cf51f45d15ab0de7653c9471be6744a8 one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low
49fddc188547ceed107c560e4e129e1f great camera  and for the price you can t beat it
7535f2ba14887c38e6ac8f7506ffcfe4 i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly
af7d35dfb477b1380d658f4b0e01cb93 the quality is superb
ce241be0dc19c920cb8070b418b49068 the small size is perfect for my little hands  but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person
c258388ac50d5b84b13964b0049cfc7c it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot
c04938f6d553c4e369ea501705c0aff3 it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for generalto moderate snapping
97224a9d11f9869b7bb37913f20d0e1d they take excellent macro shots as well
edb3b3c6a9612649298f6346ee785f39 the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies
e57e4cc3bf2f9080a633de533530e261 i compared this to a lot of other cameras  believe me  it s value for money
af84fa31887ee8e6bec010e54f41b54b the picturers are amazing
164dda298348d815567dec7d16e56e32 recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card  as expected  i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m4m pixel  fine combos and many of the userfriendly functions are very similar to slr models  and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately
9e23440344513995e9ef9d800416e9c8 a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories  as always

d8ae4e38ba46e2a5b51819e114d5c4bf i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you downnow buy it
3b23a6676433e5d337c07af06b5eb348 i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations
42f0ce4c366e69f992de1c95467b18e7 the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away
379dfca54f93189bf1ffa8a9ccae065d 3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate  but not very robust
d70accb3661a2674ab2766a0dd695dae in summary  i love this camera and would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range
c0cd1658c30cb16d99fbca9f888c59f5 great camera

c1a2a8c959c589c71818b293fabc625c i got this camera about a month ago and i can t put it down
6ab5e8c4fc8cb5905e79f4c8ff6d9ff5 autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all
0d8e8b4e2ac064b6d95ba6b1626e37d3 i am extremely satisfied with this camera

d03f98646be6254d949650bd4e9d9ba9 after using it for about a month  i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck
7e902b1c3bac0da57adc7cb4cce23d18 its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wideangle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake
b13c80fc598343871332702ba79bf0a7 yes  the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range
cc90bbee0ce57ccc7e1b784c1f46fd96 the design and construction are excellent  as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics
9a500297c21bf39ce8d23a80a2266c9f there are so many functions in this little  yet powerful camera
a5d898eb672a4f4889c7cc06168cb6da but this camera is great
c7a84f3bce8b390d7c504dda126b0043 the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to
69cd91eb12dfeb95ccbf465a278b5453 the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice
f8fa77a39d46ecc23ee6c2f2659dd3e5 ooh  and i dropped it and it still works fine  this little camera has so many features i have nt even gotten to all of them yet
1769a914d0cd227d1f05d83abc44b3d3 it s easy for beginners to use  but has features that more serious photographers will love  so it s an excellent camera to grow into
d27aa3bf91dd03907b232f24ef4eeb12 it s light weight enough to take with you everywhere  but powerful enough to get outstanding pix
2f83fe76d6c65089aa8744a484b1d5d3 i m amazed at the photo quality  prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints
cc9dccf941a21ed9c992e937dd87e6d7 8mb for a camera like this is a joke
2abada426eb39ff34e5f9db63fa51f6e 1 it has all the features an amatuer photoenthusiast would want

8ea89a382ec48b0e0d5b6dadc5ced358 2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wideangle  wce 68  the optical viewfinder is partially obscured
a3c39ca74e64f9139dabb40cc958b72d this camera was affordable  very easy to learn  and produces spectacular images
d06f8f2da7d367fc21c6523bb8a6ed32 it s size also makes it ideal for travel
e389400b358904930d1a6caf7c8dd8e6 overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable  robust  and useful little camera
0bf10edcdbe26b58e9aa01bf73526b56 awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package
